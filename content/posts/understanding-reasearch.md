Science has taken a beating of late, with many politicians doing what they can to undermine research that contradicts their pet theories. This is not a new phenomenon. It goes back even to the early days of scientific inquiry when visionaries such as Galileo were threatened by the Church because they had the audacity to suggest that the accepted explanations for phenomona that were promulgated by the Church were wrong. They, of course, were ultimately proven to be correct in their conclusions. Still, they suffered excommunication, jail, banishment from the kingdom and a host of other punishments for their infractions.

We are seeing, I think, a similar response today with the government condemning and defunding research that challenges the government's position in many areas such as vaccinations, etc.

I think there are two problems that underlie the current trend in anti-science rhetoric.

First, as mentioned above, people don't like it when science provides evidence that their pet beliefs are wrong. RFK, Jr. is a case in point. He holds a certain set of beliefs regarding science and medical research and, because of his position in government has decided that any research that suggests that his beliefs are wrong must be defunded. Like the Church leaders in the Middle Ages, he chooses to ignore the reality that science presents.

Second, people generally don't understand research, how it is conducted, what its limits are, and why there are often contradictions in the reported results.  

In this post  I want to provide, I hope, some clarifications to help the reader understand research just a bit better.

### Research will NEVER state that something is 100% true or effective

Many people seem to believe that science should be able to give us a 100% answer to a question and become confused with different studies of the same phenomenon give different results.

That does not mean that the studies are wrong. It is simply recognizing that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of factors that influence the outcomes of a study and, similarly, the benefit or harm some phenomenon might provide. It is impossible to account for all of those factors or combinations of factors in a given study. So, different researchers might look at the same phenomenon from a slightly different perspective and, as a result, find slightly different answers.

If you take, let's say, ten groups of people, chosen at random from a large population of people, you are going to have ten groups with slightly different characteristics. Perhaps those differences are genetic, perhaps they're socio-economic differences (which can impact a host of factors in themselves), perhaps they're differences in race or cultural differences. If you conduct the exact same study on each of those ten groups, you're very likely to get different outcomes. Why? Because those differences between the groups may have unanticipated effects on the outcome of the study.

And, if we control for some of those differences, say socio-economic factors for example, then the results of the study cannot be generalized to a larger population because the larger population may not share the same factors that influence the group that was studied.



Let's take a medication trial for example. Let's imagine that a new drug for heart disease is being tested. Researcher #1 identifies a specific group of patients to study using the drug. Now, researchers try to get a cross-section of the population for their study to provide a better sense of the efficacy of the drug. But, you'll never get a truly representational group of people. Within every grou











### Why Research Seems to Contradict Itself.

One of the more confusing aspects of research is that often reports come out about research on some given topic which seems to contradict earlier reports. Why is this?

Two things are at play here. 

The challenge in any research project is ensuring that you are measuring what you think you're measuring and that the results of the research are due to the studied phenomenon and not some other, unaccounted for, process. That is, when we are testing the efficacy of a medication we want to ensure that the results of the test are due to the medication and not due, for example, to some other factor such as an interaction between the medication and the liquid in which it was administered.

To ensure this, well designed studies limit extraneous factors that could impact the results. That is, the study is conducted with very precise control over potential influences. We want to ensure that when we study a vaccine, for example, that we are seeing the effects of the vaccine and not some other factor.

In reality, though, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of factors that exist in life that may impact the efficacy of the vaccine in the real world. To counter this, multiple studies are done using both similar and dissimilar study groups. While this furthers the value of the study, meaning that it provides further proof that the vaccine or whatever is being studied, is effective, it also means that the results obtained may be different. So, we can test drug A on one group and find it to be effective while on another group the results come out differently. Why? Because people are different! 

Does this mean the results are wrong? Nope. It s



But limiting extraneous factors also limits the utility of the study. 


In order to fully understand some phenomenon it is necessary for the researcher to narrow their focus to a very limited set of
