I ran across an interesting site a few days ago and have spent the last couple of days testing it out.  It's called micro.blog. What intrigued me about it was that it allows both long-form writing as well as short, Twitter-like messages. One of the frustrations I have had with my current blog is that it isn't really amenable to sharing short, quick thoughts and observations of life I often have. This appeared to be a reasonable alternative.

The other thing that intrigued me is that you can continue to write your long-form posts on your existing blog then import them into your micro.blog site. As I understood it, you should be able to import all your old posts via RSS. This, however, doesn't appear to be working at the moment. At least for me.

I'm not sure if I've misunderstood how that process works, if I've misconfigured something, or it just isn't working correctly. I'll continue to work to try to get it working the way I *think* it's supposed to work and, if I can't, well ... I'll just have to see.
