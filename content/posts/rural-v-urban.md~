# Rural vs Urban Living

For most of my life I've lived in more suburban areas. And, since this is what I've known and am comfortable with, this is often my "go-to" when looking for a home.

In fact, my tendency has always been to lean rural. I once went looking for a home that I could "sit on my front porch buck naked and nobody would know or care." I wanted that privacy. I wanted that distance from others. I am not a terribly social person so being out in the sticks where I don't have to deal with neighbors has always had an appeal to me. 

The flip side of that desire is that I also tend to like convenience.  I like having grocery stores, bookstores, and the like near at hand. In addition to convenience, I also find that I do get a certain energy from being around others -- in moderation.  If there's too much activity or the crowds are too large I quickly become overwhelmed. There is simply too much demand on my system. So there's something of a fine balance between drawing energy from being in the midst of active people and becomin


 
Of course, finding a rural location that offered the kind of seclusion I wanted that is also relatively convenient isn't easy. Well, mostly it's impossible.

In recent years my attitude has begun to change and that has created a bit of struggle. Let me explain.

When my wife and I started seriously talking about retirement, we considered beach towns in Florida. One of the attractions for that lifestyle was that often a car wasn't needed. You could walk or bike to many of the shops that you needed to visit and because the land is generally pretty flat, such excursions were not particularly taxing physically.  This meant that we could get where we wanted to go fairly quickly and very inexpensively, all while getting in some good physical exercise that would help to maintain our overall health.

Well, the costs associated with living on the coast, together with the high heat and humidity and the general level of crowds

Over the last few years I've spent a fair amount of time learning about other countries. One of the features that stand out to me, particularly in European countries, is the convenience of being within walking distance of shops, grocers, and so on. The availability of public transportation which mitigates the need for a car is also a big attraction.  Owning a vehicle is expensive. Car payments, insurance, fuel, maintenance, all of those costs add up. I can pay for a LOT of Uber rides for what it costs to own a vehicle. So the idea of living in a place where a car isn't needed is very appealing.
