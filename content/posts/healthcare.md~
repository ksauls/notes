After spending more than 40 years working in healthcare I believe I have some foundation for understanding why healthcare is so expensive. Now this is not an all-inclusive look but is, instead, a look through my lens, a lens that is limited to a specific area of the country and specific healthcare experiences. With that in mind let's take a look at a few of the reasons that seem to contribute to the issue.

## Insurance

An argument I hear periodically, and it's one that has sprung up quite a bit in the last few weeks as government shut down with healthcare costs being a sticking point, is that insurance has led to many of the increases.  There is some evidence that healthcare costs began to rise only after healthcare insurance became widespread, including the introduction of Medicare in 1965. One of the key tenets of macroeconomics is the demand/supply curve.  That is, as demand increases againsts a limited supply, prices will rise.  This is the case with healthcare.  As more companies offered health insurance as a benefit and Medicare was implemented the demand for healthcare services increased significantly.  The supply of services, however, did not grow proportionately and, as a result, the price for those services rose. With this in mind, those who oppose the ACA do so recognizing that the demand for healthcare will continue to rise, pushing costs higher.

To be honest, while I don't disagree with that basic premise, I also recognize that the costs have risen much more than the supply/demand curve would seem to suggest. so, there are other factors that come into play

A second reason is that for a long time both Medicare and Insurance companies tended to pay whatever was billed.  That was, essentially, an open checkbook for hospitals and physicians.  While I firmly believe that most MDs did not take advantage of that situation, far too many did.  Hospitals saw an opportunity to grow and develop new lines of business and found that they could finance that growth by increasing their billing. So they did. It's important to remember that at the time most hospitals were not-for-profit and often supported with a combination of tax dollars and patient billings. All of this is to say that when the payor will pay whatever is billed the temptation to inflate prices and/or bill for services that may not have been rendered is tempting. Too many are unable to avoid temptation.

A third reason, more recent reason, is the explosion of technologies associated with healthcare. Now, I'm not opposed to technology that truly adds value to the experience but there is, I think, a lot of misuse or overuse of technology. There's no coordination of resources; every hospital wants its own MRI or CT or whatever the latet technology is because they can bill for it.  The problem is that often the capacity in some communities exceeds the actual demand. As a result, one of two things has to happen: the price per episode has to increase to cover the costs; or, the technology is used indiscrimately to generate more revenue.

As a consequence of the demands of both private and government insurance (i.e Medicare and Medicaid) for documentation of need and coding, etc hospitals and doctor's office must hire multiple people to handle insurance claims and billing.  Coding, which is the process for documenting services billed, has become big business. Those requirements and the need to hire people specifically to manage these processes only further increases the costs.  As an aside here, I recently watched a video of an American couple who moved to France describe their experience with the French healthcare system.  First, let me note that they were extremely satisfied with the care they received. But they noted that there were no receptionists in their doctor's offices and no billing department. Nor, apparently, were their any office nurses.  The MD came into the sparsely decorated waiting area, took the patient back, did all of the workup (blood work, weight, etc) and even handled the billing, which consisted of swiping their healthcare payment card. While I have no actual numbers, I suspect that by foregoing all of hte office staff seen in American doctor's offices, the cost of that visit would likley be hundreds of dollars less.[^1]

Another reason, I think, is that often the patient has little or no skin in the game. This has two consequences. First, because the bill is paid by insurance, the patient pays little attention to the costs involved.  More to the point, they often demand treatments that are not cliearly indicated regardless of cost because the cost is not a factor in their decision-making. Second, because insurance is the primary payor, the insurance company, rather than the patient, is seen as the 'customer'.


## Hospitals' Contribution to High Costs
