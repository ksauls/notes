# Do You Have a Passion Project?

I'm always fascinated when I hear or read about someone who devotes significant time and effort into what they call their passion project.  I mean, how do they come up with those ideas? What makes something a passion project?

I was similarly awed back when I first began my doctoral journey by my classmates who were able to clearly spell out what phenomenon they wanted to research for their dissertation. How did they come to that? I wondered.  I never felt that type of deep seated interest in a topic such that it drove me to want to invest time and energy into it. Or, maybe I did but didn't recognize it. I think it's fairly common among doctoral students to ask others about their intended dissertation topic. Whenever I was asked I always said that I didn't know; nothing stood out as worthy of that type of effort. And I was always assured that as I moved through my studies something would pique my interest and I'd want to know more. That, they said, would be my topic. Well, I got to the end of my studies with no greater idea than when I began.  I was able, ultimately, to identify a topic that was of interest to me, but certainly not something that I would consider a "passion".

Similarly, I read all the time about people who somehow manage to turn their passion project into a full-time, paying job. Or they start a movement that grows beyond all expectations. Alexander Kallaway, for example, wanted to learn to code. He didn't want to go back to school to learn computer science so he set out to teach himself. To push himself and to help hold himself accountable for acheiving that goal he publically announced his goal to code for 1 hour a day for 100 days. His public challenge led others to join his efforts. He published specific rules to help guide his and his friends efforts. At the end of the day, though, it was all about accountability.  Learning to code  had become his passion project and one which he transformed into a world-wide movement. Within short order (18 months) thousands of people would be using his #100DaysOfCode hashtag to share their work.

Alex's story illustrates how a simple desire can be transformed into somthing that is, well, transformative. But, again, how
