It's hard to believe, but in a few days, I will celebrate sixty-seven trips around the sun.  I have now lived longer than both of my parents and several of my uncles. Given a family history of deaths at younger ages for the men, I'm just a tad surprised that I'm still kicking. And kicking well!

It's odd, though.  I don't *feel* 67.  I feel more like 25 or 30. Well, except for the bad knee and tweaky shoulder. In fact, I actually feel better today than I did, say, twenty years ago.

I'm generally pretty healthy. The persistent headaches and indigestion that were part of my life since my early twenties, both brought on by stress, are gone. I'm mentally in a much better space. The sudden outbursts of anger (also I think from stress) have receded into obscurity. I'm active. All in all, I'm pretty happy where I find myself as I start my 68th tour around the Sun.

I've heard others talk about how people seem to mellow out as they age. I find that to be true for myself (though maybe my loved ones would disagree?) I wonder how much of that comes with retirement and letting go of the stress and strain of our jobs.

Being 67 but feeling 30 means I also have to remind myself that those pretty young women I see aren't as likely to want to chat with me as they once were. And that's a odd feeling for me. You see, working as a nurse you learn to build friendships with those young women. They're not love interests, but friends. You talk together, share life stories. And talking with women of all ages just seems very natural to me. At 67, though, those younger ones don't appreciate (as in understand or value) that kind of interaction.  I guess I don't blame them; I am an "old man" to them.

But, I am living my best life. I do what I want, when I want. I explore topics, hobbies, and activities the interest me. I find pleasure in simple things and don't (always) feel the need to be constantly "productive".  I no longer see doing nothing as time wasted, I see it as time to be savored. Now, my wife will tell you I'm always busy. And, that's true. But, again, I'm busy with the things that interest me and as the old saying goes, "doing what you love means you'll never work a day in your life." I'm doing what I love.

So, on Sunday I start my 68th trip around the Sun and I am excited to see what the coming tour offers.  I'll let you come along for the ride.
