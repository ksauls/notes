If you've ever watched House Hunters on HGTV or any number of YouTube videos on moving to other countries one of the common themes you'll hear is that people are moving "for a slower pace of life". I've also run across dozens of articles in various magazines and websites that speak to this, as well. And it's something I've never really quite understood. The question that always comes to my mind is, "why can't they find that here?"

Whenever I hear those words, they're usually followed by a list of all of the activities they are involved in. Often, that discussion revolves around children's activities such as various sports, dance classes, etc. It's not uncommon for them to mention that their children are all involved in multiple activities which means that the kids -- and therefore, the adults -- are constantly on the run shuttling from one activity to another. For the adults this means getting each kid to different activities at different locations, all within a fairly tight timeframe.  So, it seems to me that the "busy, always-on-the-go life" they are complaining about is of their own making.

But, before we can talk about this issue we really need to define what we're talkiing about when we say we're looking for a slower pace of life.  What does that mean? What does it look like? Doing this, it seems to me, can help you identify ways in which to slow down. And I suspect that the definition of a slower pace of life differs for each person.

### What is a Slower Pace of Life?

For me, it is a slower pace of life means taking the time to simply enjoy the day and being present at any given point in time.  I am notorious, as I think most of us are, for being in one place but thinking about what's next or what we should/could be doing instead. That type of thinking promotes both a sense of being rushed and a sense that we are not being productive.  But that, then, requires that we define what it means to be productive which I choose not to do at this point.

Living a slower pace of life also means identifying what is truly important to us. Do we value getting things done over enjoying the people we are with at this moment in time?  Do we value scrolling on our phones over talking with those that we are with? Is money more important to us than the friendships we build and the experiences we have? 



So, to me the first step in creating that slower pace of life is to look carefully at what you're doing and what you're committed to.  Do you really need to be doing all of the things you're doing? Do you really need to go to the gym to get exercise? Why not Still, there are, I think, some legitimate reasons why creating a slower pace of life is a bit more challenging in the US.
