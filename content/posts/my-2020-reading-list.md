# My 2020 Reading List

I set as a goal in 2020 the ambitious aim to complete 50 books over 52 weeks.  I didn't quite get there, but I did manage to complete 26.  In addition, I read parts of four others and read probably a 100 or more journal and long-form magazine articles from a variety of sources.  The four that I did not complete simply failed to sustain my interest. In general, I try to muddle through a book out of respect to the author's efforts.  But, I have come to realize <!-- more --> that sometimes the best use of my time is not to spend time on an endeavor that I found not interesting or relevant to my interests.  A couple of others, chiefly on electronics, I'm still working on, as they are detailed, and time-consuming.

For 2021 I have set a goal of 30 books (pushing up just a bit from 2020).  We'll see how I fare.

Here, though, are the books that I completed in 2020:
