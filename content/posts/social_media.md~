Back in the early aughts, when this phenomenon called "social media" first appeared, with MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and the like first came into the public consciousness, I was a bit flummoxed. I couldn't quite understand why these sites drew the kind of attention they did.  Still, wanting to stay abreast of the latest trends, I tried them. Well, at least some of them. Most of my efforts revolved around the classes I was teaching at the time.

One of the tools I looked at was Twitter. I was doing a good bit of reading that Twitter was a great tool for communicating with students. Teachers were sending out snippets of information for students to consider. Or sending short questions to challenge them. It seemed a good way to continually challenge students. The problem with this, though, was that it required that I be pretty much constantly on-line, frequently posting and so on. I tired of that pretty quickly and didn't get a lot of supportive feedback from my students so  I soon abandoned it.

While I abandoned the platform, many others didn't. Obviously.  But for the life of me I struggled to understand the appeal. Why did I care what someone thought on some topic that wasn't relevant to me?  Why did people feel that they were so important that their every thought had to be communicated to the world via 140 character missives?

And the same was true for Facebook. The original idea behind Facebook, as I recall, was to allow classmates to communicate with each other, make plans to meet, announce activities, etc. And that made some kind of sense to me.  But, I wasn't in school and didn't have a large group of people with whom I kept in touch (or wanted to!) so, again, I wasn't terribly impressed by the platform.  Only once I began my doctoral journey did I create an account so that  I could communicate with my classmates and with my kids who, by that time, were using the platform for their social networking.
