I joined Bluesky a month or so ago and one of the things that has caught my attention is that it seems a lot of folks who post there are posting the books they've read, are reading, or plan to read.  Now, there's absoluely nothing wrong with that. I have been known to do that myself.

What caught my eye, though, was the number of people who boast about the number of books they've read or, as the new year begins, have set goals for how many books they will read this year.  Can I just say I think that's the stupidest thing you can possibly do?

### Why I Read

I read for two reasons: Either to learn something new or for pleasure. For the first reason, I want to add to my knowledgebase, widen my worldview, or broaden my understanding of the world around me.  These things help me to better understand, interpret, and interact with the world. They provide a foundation for making decisions and can help provide context for what is happening. They contribute to my critical thinking skills, allowing me to utilize what I've learned in order to identify and consider alternatives. I spend a lot of my time reading materials that contribute to my knowledgebase.

The second reason, reading for pleasure, is just that -- reading for the enjoyment of the story line. Reading to fill my time with something worthwhile rather than simply filling my time with mindless TV or doomscrolling on the computer. Reading for pleasure, though, can also contribute to my understanding of the world around me. The classics, in particular, provide insight into the human condition and can remind me that there are other ways of experiencing the world. 

Both of these approaches to reading, though, require time.  Time to comprehend what I'm reading, time to digest what I've read, and time to integrate my reading into my existing views. When I'm reading to learn, I want to take the time to actually understand what I'm reading because my goal is to *learn*.  When I reading for pleasure, I want to take the time to actually enjoy the experience. I want to be able to visualize the story, to step into the character's skin to experience the story as they do. 

And I don't think setting reading goals, particularly in the number of books read, allows for that kind of time or experience. The goal, rather than the knowledge or experience, becomes the focus.
