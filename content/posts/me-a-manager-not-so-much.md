# Me? A Manager? Not so Much

For the past year or so my manager has 
been after me to move into a management role.  I managed to avoid doing so until 
fairly recently, using my work on my doctorate as an excuse for not really 
having the time to take on all the work of learning the role, learning the 
courses I would manage and so forth.  Recently, however, I was approached again 
and, having all-but completed my degree, really didn't have a good reason for 
<!-- more -->not acting. So I applied and went through two steps of the interview process.  I 
didn't get the job.  Exactly why, though, I'm not sure. I do know that they had 
multiple applicants and no one was chosen.  That's fine.  That experience, 
though, got me to really thinking about whether I really wanted to continue to 
pursue a management position.

## The Answer is "No" ##

It's pretty common, I think, for people to expect that as you gain experience in 
a field that you'll want to move up within that field.  For most people, that 
means moving into management.  And, if that's truly where you want to be, that's 
a good plan.  But, when people begin to expect you to move up and you don't -- 
particularly by choice -- they begin to wonder why not.  Why, they ask, aren't 
you interested in growing?  Or, why don't you want to improve yourself?  Some 
organizations even set the expectation that you either express a desire to move 
'up the ladder' or move on.  They (wrongfully) equate a lack of desire to 'move 
up' with a lack of motivation to do good work.  They are very short-sighted. 
Ignorant, even.

Here's the thing in my own case.  I began pursuit of my doctorate not because I 
wanted to 
become a manager but because I wanted to teach.  It really doesn't make sense to 
get a degree that fully qualifies me to teach and then abandon teaching for 
management.  Perhaps as importantly, management is simply not me. I've done 
management.  I have a degree in management.  I'm not a good manager. My manager 
disagrees and that's okay.  The problem is that he is evaluating my life through 
his lens. 

There's also the simple fact that leadership and management are often seen as 
being the same thing. They 
are not.  I am a good leader.  I have good ideas, I see ways that things can be 
done differently and more effectively, and I am good a communicating those 
thoughts.  I look at things through a different lens, which allows me to present 
alternative ways of seeing and approaching things.  And, because I am both good 
at expressing those thoughts and pretty much unafraid to bring up questions, 
others listen to me.

But, just because I am a good leader doesn't mean I'll be a good manager.  The 
requisite skills are different.  Perhaps more importantly, the constraints on 
the two roles are different.  As a manager I am constrained to present the 
organization's perspective in a positive light, at least to those under my 
management.  As a simple employee, I'm free to voice my frustrations and 
disagreements with the 'company view'. That can be dangerous, but is less likely 
to garner significant backlash than if I did so as a manager.

## Academics and Management ##

I can't speak for anyone other than myself, so that heading is a bit misleading.  
But, it seems to me that academics go into education for one of three reasons.  
* First, they genuinely enjoy teaching. They enjoy the interaction with 
students. 
They love to see that "ah ha!" look in the students' faces when the students 
connect the 
dots and a concept crystallizes for them.  
* Second, they are curious (I'll write 
more about that later) and academia allows them to satisfy that curiosity and 
to share the fruits of their curiosity with others.  
* Third, I know at least 
some people who come into education more as an avoidance of or escape from some 
unpleasant work experience than for any particular desire to educate.  This 
third group may also include people who can simply no longer function in the 
workplace due to age or infirmity.  Nurses, for example, may come into teaching 
more because they can no longer physically do the work of nursing. There's 
nothing wrong with that, though they may not be the most effective educators.  I 
do disagree with the old saw that "Them what can, do; Them what can't, teach."  
I don't think that's true.  In my experience, teaching is simply an expression 
of what drives the individual.

None of these reasons points to the need for a position in management.  It's not 
about power or authority. It's about sharing with others and exploring one's own 
interests. It's not about growing into more 'responsible' positions (whatever 
that means), it's about growing in understanding and insight and 
accomplishments. I don't see the ability to manage others or to implement the 
plans and goals of others as necessarily being growth. Nor do I see stifling my 
own perspectives, interests, and curiosity in order to meet some vague corporate 
conception of what I should be as a desirable thing.  

In short, I've given it thought and I will not be pursuing management anytime in 
the foreseeable future.  I want to grow, but as a person and as an intellectual, 
not as a minion to those with more titular 'power'.
