I ran across an article that referenced the book "The Time Traveler's Wife" by Audrey Niffenegger.  Not being familiar with the work, I did a quick search and found some critiques of the work.  While the book was clearly quite popular and generally well-received, at least one critic noted that the book is made up of emotional considerations that "never quite add up to a plot". 

That got me to thinking ... why is a plot needed?  Stories are about life. The last time I looked, life most definitely does not have a plot.  So, if stories are indeed about life, is a plot really needed? Are there times when the story simply reflects life as it is lived? 

I remember back in high school when the teacher always wanted us to identify the author's intent with their books.
