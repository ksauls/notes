# How Time Flies

Okay, granted not the most original title, but the fact is I really didn&#8217;t realize it had been nearly four months since my last post. If you read that one, though, you might be inclined to forgive me &#8212; I&#8217;ve been a bit busy. But, today those crazy hours are behind me and only a single paper remains between me and the end of the term.

There has been so much that has captured my interest this term that I&#8217;ve simply not been able to write about. I hope that I&#8217;ll have the time in the coming weeks to catch up on my writing. Be watching for more &#8230;
