# Making Progress ... Slowly

There has been a lot going on the last few months.  I have been struggling to 
get my dissertation done. The biggest obstacle has been locating participants 
for a qualitative study.  I *finally* got responses to my recruiting efforts and 
have been able to interview 7 people.  That's not a great response, but is 
better than nothing (which is what I had in the past!) 
<!-- more -->
and allows me to move 
forward.  Did I say I was excited?

Having finally gotten the data collected, themed, coded, and all the other 
things you do to qualitative data, I finally sat down to write.  For the past 
four and a half 
days that's pretty much all I've done: write.  yes, I have literally been 
writing 8 - 10 hours a day for the past nearly 5 days.  And I'm not done.  I'm 
getting close, mind you, but I haven't crossed the finish line.  I hope to do 
that soon.
