There's a storm a-comin' that threatens us with multiple days without power. I've been through this before, in a differnt house, and we survived just fine. And we learned a few things in that process. Moreover, since then I've learned about a few options that help make the process even easier.

Following a previous multi-day power outage several years ago, I went out and bought a reasonably sized portable generator.  Fortunately, we haven't had need of it since then but anticipate relying on it in the coming days.

One of the things I'm doing differently than I think many people are doing is including in my plans the use of a couple of one-killowatt hour power stations. These are essentially batteries with a built-in charge controller and inverter that allows us to minimize the use of the generator. This will stretch our fuel out for a longer period of time.

The power stations will provide hours of light, internet acces, and television computer usage. It'll also allow us to make some light meals, coffee, hot tea or hot chocolate, etc. without having to fire up the generator.  In fact, I only plan to run the generator to recharge the the power stations and to periodically run an electric heater to take the chill off the rooms we use.
