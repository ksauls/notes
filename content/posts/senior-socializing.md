# Senior Socializing

If you've read any of the literature on aging engaging in social activities with others is one of the most commonly cited contributors to an overall sense of well-being, maintaining cognitive function, and even to longevity.  As a rule, I've always been a bit of skeptic on that front believing that while this may be _generally_ true, it really depends on the person.  I am not a social person.  I have always been a bit of an introvert. No small part of that is because, as I discussed in [this essay]({{< relref "am I on the spectrum" >}}) I believe I may have some autistic tendencies that show up through social awkwardness.  I'm never really comfortable in social situations because I really don't know how to make small talk, a necessary skill in most social situations. My skepticism comes in the form of wondering if the stress and anxiety that comes from being uncomfortable in most social situations counteracts any benefit of those situations.

The truth is, I haven't really had close friends in over 40 years. Acquaintenances, sure. Co-workers, of course. And while I get along fairly well at work, I never, and I do mean never, socialize with co-workers outside of work. 

I do, however, like the mental stimulation that comes from learning. Sometimes the best way to learn is through a class. So, finding ways to take classes has become an important activity.

Recently my wife and I learned about the [Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes](https://osherfoundation.org) (OLLI), an organization that supports people over age 50 with courses, special interest groups (SIGS), travel and other activities to help keep us not-so-young folk engaged and active. There are about 125 programs based on university and college campuses around the US. Each local chapter(?) sets its own schedule of activities and classes.

We attended an information session (an "OLLI Fest") where newcomers like us were introduced to all of the programs, events, and SIGS that are available through the OLLI program at the University of Georgia which is near our home.  We joined with the idea that it would give us opportunities to get out of the house and, despite my reservations, allow us to meet new people. 

This morning we participated in our first event. On Tuesdays and Thursdays each week the group meets at some location and spends and hour walking -- OLLI walks -- and socializing. The purpoes is both for socialization and exercise. This particular day the group, which varies in size depending on the day, the weather, etc, met at a park that my wife and I frequented when we first moved to town. [^1] It is a great park, with well maintained walking paths. To do the outer loop takes about 45 minutes at an moderate pace and covers about 2 miles.  We thought that this would be a good introduction since we were familiar with the setting and, if we decided the group didn't fit us, we could just wander off on our own!

Now, I have to be honest. I slept poorly last night and didn't really feel up to going, but figured I'd go just to keep my wife happy and because I need to walk regardless of where. That said, though, the walk was a good one, though the humidity was uncomfortably high and by the end of it I felt much better.

More to the point, and I guess the point of this little essay, is that I enjoyed not just the walk, which we had done many times, but meeting new people. We felt immediately welcomed and, perhaps because of the activity, I did not feel the usual anxiety I feel when thrust into new social situations. I can't say I made any new friends today, but certainly made some new acquaitenances that could perhaps become friends. With work on my part.

Will we do it again? Yep. I suspect we'll be going again next Tuesday, weather permitting, since we're going to a location we've not been to and that will give us a chance to learn about a new part of our community and perhaps meet a few new people, too!

[^1]: When we first moved to the area our home was still under construction so we ended up living in a hotel for three months. We discovered the park and develped the habit of starting our day walking the park, then going back to the hotel for breakfast and then to work.
