There have been a lot of discussions recently about how tipping the US has gotten out of control.  Everyone, it seems, wants to be tipped for doing their jobs. Go to the local donut shop, walk up to the counter, order two donuts and a cup of coffie and there is a) a tip jar on the counter and b) a tip line on the credit card reader. Sorry?  You want a tip for literally putting two donuts in a bag and filling a cup with coffee?  I think not! The same is true at many fast food joints.  

The issue has become so pervasive that there is a sub on Reddit dedicated to this very topic. There, people share their experiences some of which, assuming they are true, are just ridiculous. Tips being added to tickets before the customer receives the bill, tips amounts being changed, servers and cashiers giving you the evil eye if you don't tip the "right" amount, etc. 

It's gotten so ridiculous that I recently bought an item online and on the payment page I found this:

In what world should a WEBSITE expect a tip?  What am I tipping for?  WHO am I tipping?  I just paid 80 bucks for product and the COMPANY expects a tip? 

Did I mention that tippings seems to have gotten out of hand?
