The one thing that has surprised me is that I've become interested in the Fediverse. If you're not familiar with that term, well, which rock have you been under?  Seriously, the "Fediverse" is decentralized network of individual servers that interconnect so that you can experience the whole network even though you're only signed into the one server. With a few exceptions each server is designed around specific community interests, whether that's technical interests, social interests, and so on.  For example, there's a "linuxmoms" community for women who choose to use Linux. There are LGBTQ+ communities, and so on.  And, unlike X or facebook and other corporate entities, the fediverse is distributed: No one owns it, no one entity controls it, and no one entity can shut it down. Oh, and it's free to join and use.

Sounds great, so why did that surprise me?  I've never been a "social media" person. No X (or twitter), no Facebook (okay, I have an account but it's pretty barren and lonely because I almost never visit it and do not post at all). But the idea of the Fediverse intrigued me so I set up a Mastodon account. We'll see how that works out. And, of course, micro.blog also has a similar option for sharing whimsical thoughts that clutter up my brain (and now, I guess, my timeline!)
