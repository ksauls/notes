# So, What's This Site All About?

Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the web &#8230; yes, I know that&#8217;s a bit clich√© but &#8230; well, what can I say?

Anyway, I am a doctoral student in Education (Nursing education to be precise) and have decided to use a blogging platform as a means for storing ideas and thoughts related to topics that might be useful as I move toward my dissertation. And, it&#8217;s a great way to begin stretching my writing legs, solidify ideas, and perhaps my thinking to a bit of public scrutiny, as well.

What you&#8217;ll find here will likely be pretty much an amalgam of ideas, thoughts, random rants, and explorations of concepts related to MOOCs, learning via social media, learning commons and the like. Oh, and I&#8217;ll probably throw in the occasional exploration of software related to writing, research and such (particularly as they relate to dissertations!)

One last thought &#8230; I welcome public discourse on my ideas; that&#8217;s how ideas grow and develop. If you choose to contribute, great! But, be aware that if your idea of contributing is flaming, trolling and so forth your posts will be deleted and you will be banned. Let&#8217;s grow together, not tear each other down ..
