# What Am I Doing Now?

## What Am I Working On?

- I try to write a blog post every working day (Mon-Fri)
- I am trying my hand at writing fiction (though it's very bad fiction!)
- I am learning about learning (that's an on-going endeavor)
- I am studying operating systems e.g. BSD and Linux

## What Am I Reading?

- _Advice to a Young Investigator_ by Santiago Ramon y Cajal 
  Ramon y Cajal was a significant contributor to our knowledge of how the nervous system works. His history is quite interesting and aligns with my interest in learning how to learn. In this text he is providing guidance on how to do proper research.
  
- CompTIA Linux+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, second edition
  I have not intent to actually get certified but after 25 years of mucking about in Linux, I though it about time to actually focus on learning more about the system and strengthen my skill set as I look at doing more computer work in retirement.
  
## What's on my Reading List?
These are listed in no particular order but are books I would like to read at some point

- _The Brain in Search of Itself_ by Benjamin Erhlich, Timothy Pabon, et al.
  More about Ramon y Cajal
  
- _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear

- _The Listening Book_ by Robin Ticic, Elise Kushner, et al

- _The Vagabond's Way_ by Rolf Potts
  My wife and I are setting goals for travel and this book may provide insights for doing it well.
