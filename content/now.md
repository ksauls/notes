## What Am I Working On?

- I try to write a blog post every working day (Mon-Fri)
- I am trying my hand at writing fiction (though it's very bad fiction!)
- I am learning about learning (that's an on-going endeavor)
- I am studying operating systems e.g. BSD and Linux
- mucking around with the IndieWeb and the Fediverse.

## What Am I Reading?

- Vagabond's Way by Rolf Potts (a daily meditation on travel)
- How to be a Stoic by Massimo Pigliucci
(You didn't think I'd *really* read just *one* book at a time, did you?)

## What's on my Reading List?
These are listed in no particular order but are books I would like to read at some point

- _The Brain in Search of Itself_ by Benjamin Erhlich, Timothy Pabon, et al.
  More about Ramon y Cajal
