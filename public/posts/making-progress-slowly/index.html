  <h1 id="making-progress--slowly">Making Progress &hellip; Slowly</h1>
<p>There has been a lot going on the last few months.  I have been struggling to
get my dissertation done. The biggest obstacle has been locating participants
for a qualitative study.  I <em>finally</em> got responses to my recruiting efforts and
have been able to interview 7 people.  That&rsquo;s not a great response, but is
better than nothing (which is what I had in the past!)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and allows me to move
forward.  Did I say I was excited?</p>
<p>Having finally gotten the data collected, themed, coded, and all the other
things you do to qualitative data, I finally sat down to write.  For the past
four and a half
days that&rsquo;s pretty much all I&rsquo;ve done: write.  yes, I have literally been
writing 8 - 10 hours a day for the past nearly 5 days.  And I&rsquo;m not done.  I&rsquo;m
getting close, mind you, but I haven&rsquo;t crossed the finish line.  I hope to do
that soon.</p>
