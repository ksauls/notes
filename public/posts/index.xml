      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;re-envisioning-retirement&#34;&gt;Re-envisioning Retirement&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around noon on December 29, 2023 I logged out and powered down my work computer for the last time. After 40 years and 6 months of professional practice in nursing – 20 in the clinical setting and another almost 21 in teaching – I was retiring. Officially, I was to work until 4 PM that day but all of my students had been transferred to other instructors, much of my access to school resources had been rescinded, and there was nothing for me to do so, with my boss’s blessings, I called it a career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around noon on December 29, 2023 I logged out and powered down my work computer for the last time. After 40 years and 6 months of professional practice in nursing – 20 in the clinical setting and another almost 21 in teaching – I was retiring. Officially, I was to work until 4 PM that day but all of my students had been transferred to other instructors, much of my access to school resources had been rescinded, and there was nothing for me to do so, with my boss’s blessings, I called it a career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most retirees, I had envisioned what life post-work would be like. I would travel. I would do volunteer work. I would write. Maybe I’d start a YouTube channel. I’d spend time building new hobbies like electronics. Maybe I’d return to school to study topics that interested me like sociology or anthropology. Maybe I would challenge myself by learning calculus or physics. The opportunities were endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven months out from retirement and I’ve done very few of those things. Yes, I’ve done reading in sociology and anthropology, as well as philosophy. Yes, I’ve done a fair amount of writing, fleshing out ideas that have come to me over time and that I wanted to know more about. But most of my time has been spent doing routine things – mowing the grass, organizing my office, spending time with my wife, playing with the dogs. And we talk about travel. We want to visit Vermont, for example. And I’d love to spend a little time at the beach. Going to resort areas like Destin, Siesta Key, or Hilton Head is always (somewhat bizarrely&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) energizing for me. I love to people-watch and beach areas are particularly good for that type of activity. People are less conscientious about their persons when away from home and those who might know them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first retired, I wanted to get going on all the things I planned. Time was of the essence! I need to get my YouTube channel up and going. I need to get my writing published. I need to learn electronics in the next six months. And the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time has passed, though, I have begun to realize several things. First, and I mentioned this in an earlier post, I began to realize that I have, with any luck, 20 to 30 years ahead of me. Looking back at what I’ve done in the last 20 years, I know that I have time to do all things I want to do, all without rushing. Second, I spent most of my life dealing with the stress of feeling like I needed to get things done. I rushed about trying to meet obligations both real and imagined. And I still have that feeling that I “should” be doing something … writing, reading specific books, planning specific trips, etc. I found that I was still being driven by the “shoulds” that had been a part of my life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, I have begun to realize, too, that my reason for wanting to retire was, in part, to provide me more control over my life. I wanted to be able to do the things I want to do, when I want to do them, rather than on someone else’s timeline. I wanted to be able to take my time in doing things rather than rushing simply to get to the goal post. I recognize that a lot of that sense of imperative in activities comes from my Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but I want to control that and I have begun to realize that in retirement, I can. There is no reason to rush. The clock and calendar become somewhat irrelevant. I don’t need to be ‘productive’. Exploring ideas for the sake of exploration and learning is fine: there doesn’t need to be a reason for my activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This realization was underscored by an articleI read a few days ago that spoke to a way of life that prioritizes satisfaction in life over productivity. Notice I didn’t say “happiness”. Happiness is a temporary state which is, in my view, only exists in contrast to some other state. It is not possible, in my mind, to be happy all the time. You can, however, be content or satisfied most of the time. The article refers to a Swedish concept known as lagom, which roughly translates to “just enough”. As I pondered that article, I realized that it is okay to do “just enough” to keep me occupied and engaged, but not so much that I feel pressed to complete a task or activity, or meet a (self-imposed) goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After pondering those factors for a few days, I have begin to re-envision my retirement. I still have goals. I still want to travel so my wife and I will sit down and identify places we’d like to go and things we’d like to do. And I will still write, with an aim of publishing something at least every couple of weeks if not more often. And I may still create that YouTube channel. But I’m no longer in a rush to do them. I’m coming to grips with the notion that if it get done, great! If not, that’s okay, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say, “bizarrely”, because in general being in social settings for more than a couple of hours is psychologically exhausting for me. In some settings, however, where I am not required to interact with others, the hustle and bustle of activity around me and the ability to observe others (‘people watching’) can actually boost my energy level. Weird, yes, I know. But true, nonetheless! ↩︎&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;revisiting-wordstar&#34;&gt;Revisiting WordStar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day or so ago I ran across an article where science fiction writer Robert J. Sawyer had released his version of WordStar 7.0 for DOS, noting that it is now abandonware and, thus, he felt comfortable releasing it into the wild.  What was interesting was that, as he noted, not only he, but several other quite successful writers had developed quite an affinity for the ancient software that ran on a long outdated operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;revisiting-wordstar&#34;&gt;Revisiting WordStar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day or so ago I ran across an article where science fiction writer Robert J. Sawyer had released his version of WordStar 7.0 for DOS, noting that it is now abandonware and, thus, he felt comfortable releasing it into the wild.  What was interesting was that, as he noted, not only he, but several other quite successful writers had developed quite an affinity for the ancient software that ran on a long outdated operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite understandably, many who commented on his announcement questioned why &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; would continue to use the long-antiquated software that required significant tweaking to remain useful.  In fact, as the author noted, he was required to use either DosBox-X or Vdosbox in order to run the software and, further, had found it necessary to create scripts to convert the old format into something that could be sent to his publisher in the form of Microsoft Word.  That is, the work he did could not be printed directly from the machine he was using, nor could it be directly converted to Microsoft Word.  The question as to why he and others might choose to continue to the software is a valid one. Before I give you my take on it, let&amp;rsquo;s take a short stroll down memory lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I haven&amp;rsquo;t used WordStar since probably 1986 when I was in my MBA program.  Although I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even thought about WS until I read the article, I was immediately reminded of the many trips to the college library, 5.25 inch floppy disk in hand, to write my papers which were then printed on a, wait for it, dot-matrix printer.  I well remember having to learn what was then the somewhat cryptic ctrl-key commands in order to do pretty much anything in the software. I also remember the frustration experienced when I goofed and couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to get out of the pickle I&amp;rsquo;d created for myself.  But, the program was pretty amazing.  And even though it was not as user-friendly as the &lt;em&gt;Word Writer&lt;/em&gt; software I used on my Commodore 128 of the time, it was still quite a useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, like everyone else, when Microsoft Word came out I quickly jumped ship and moved over to that product, particularly once Windows came out, making the GUI the de facto standard for PCs.  And, like everyone else (almost) I quickly forgot everything I ever knew about WordStar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question remains: Why would anyone &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; use WordStar?  I think there are a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we tend to stick with what we know and what&amp;rsquo;s comfortable to us.  For writers who started out on WordStar as their first word processsor, WordStar is simply comfortable.  It is what they know. Particularly those who rely on word processors for their livelihood, transitioning to a new software requires learning new skills and this slows productivity. Moving would also require that either you convert your older work to the newer format, which did not always go so smoothly, abandon your old work, or keep that older program around so that you could make corrections to your older work as errata are identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the whole slowing productivity concept, WordStar was designed to make writing as smooth and seamless as possible.  The commands were created in a way that make it possible for the writer to navigate their document, and to format their documents, without ever moving their hands from the keyboard. There was no need for a mouse (nor was it possible to use one on early versions of the software). That designed meant that the writer could be highly productive with a minimum of physical effort.  I think the analog today might be MarkDown, which I use extensivly in my own writing.  The ability to use quick, keyboard-based commands in order to format the document as I write makes for a much more efficient process and allows me to format my writing with almost no thought &amp;ndash; muscle memory allows me to format without thinking.  And that is a definite advantage that I believe those stalwart WordStar users cling to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason, I think, that folks still choose to use WordStar is its simplicity.  Earlier I suggested that the ctrl-key combos were cryptic and challenging and, when you&amp;rsquo;re learning the software, that is true.  It is no different than learning any other software.  That said, though, unlike most GUI based word processors today (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at your MS WORD) the software is not crammed with features that perhaps only 1% of people use.  Revisiting the software and exploring the options available, I realized that everything I generally use when writing is there. And nothing more.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have to go hunting through layers of menus to find what I need.  It&amp;rsquo;s right there, under a control code.  In fact, I think there are just two (maybe three, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure) layers of menus.  All of the key features are just a key or two away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That simplicity extends to the interface itself.  There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of buzz around distraction-free writing today and many software programs have been designed around that paradigm.  WordStar provided exactly that more than 30 years ago.  When you loaded up WordStar you were brought to an essentially blank screen with just a few choices at the top of the page.  Yes, there were lists of files at the bottom half, but once you selected the file you wanted, or started a new file, you had a clean, simple screen on which to work. Spell checking was only done on command and it did not constantly suggest corrections to your writing.  One of the more frustrating things for me with the newer word processors is the incessant corrections to what I&amp;rsquo;ve written.  That damned red sqiggly line under a word telling me that it&amp;rsquo;s spelled wrong, or is the wrong word is annoying, at the least.  I mean, I &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ma tellin&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;  I don&amp;rsquo;t need the computer to tell me this wrong.  I&amp;rsquo;m the damn writer, after all; I know what I mean to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s one more feature to WordStar that most people may not realize: It&amp;rsquo;s mostly plain text.  Yes, there are control codes in the text but nothing nearly as significant as you&amp;rsquo;ll find in most Word documents.  Moreover, you can embed notes into the file so that you can refer back to them to recall your thinking as you wrote, to identify areas that may need revision or further research and those won&amp;rsquo;t show up in any printed output.  All very straightforward and easy to read and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all that said, I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to toss out my MarkDown editors just yet (I&amp;rsquo;m trying out Visual Studio Code for writing at the moment) in favor of WordStar&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, though I&amp;rsquo;d be sorely tempted if I could figure out how to export my WordStar files to HTML or some other readily consumed format.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a clone of WordStar known as WordTsar which may offer that option.  Having whetted my interest in the &amp;ldquo;ancient&amp;rdquo; word processor, I&amp;rsquo;m likely to give WordTsar a whirl.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts included a couple of options for generating either Adobe PDF documents or converting the WordStar files to Microsoft Word files in the package he released.  Unfortunately, those programs only work in Windows and I currently use Macs and Linux.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Am I on &#34;The Spectrum&#34;?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/am-i-on-the-spectrum/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past ten years I have worked from home.  Although I interacted regularly with students and other faculty, those interactions generally took place by email (my preferred method) or, when interactivity was required, by phone, Teams, or Zoom. Actual face-to-face interaction was very limited.  I liked it that way for, as odd as it may seem, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually like dealing with people directly.  I say that&amp;rsquo;s odd because I have spent my entire career in a field that required not only face-to-face interaction but, as a nurse,  often that interaction  required intimate contact with others. And, while I did need to interact on a one-to-one level in the hospital, teaching allowed me to interact with students on a more generic level. Speaking to a class or conducting on on-line lesson is easier and less stressful for me than meeting one on one with an individual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Speaking to a class or conducting on on-line lesson is easier and less stressful for me than meeting one on one with an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stress-stress-and-more-stress&#34;&gt;Stress, Stress, and More Stress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with others face-to-face has always been a struggle for me.  I hate parties and other gatherings where I&amp;rsquo;m required to &amp;lsquo;socialize&amp;rsquo; and make small talk.  I never learned how!  I struggled to make sense of the social cues that others seems to intuitively understand.  I never felt that I fit in.  Any kind of social situation generated significant stress for me and so I tried to avoid it them whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have dealt with high stress levels since my early twenties (and perhaps before, I just don&amp;rsquo;t remember).  Near constant headaches and Gastroesophageal Reflux disease (GERD) or acid indigestion, have plagued me since at least age 20.  Depression negatively influenced much of my life.  Since I began working from home where I have very limited interaction with others, however, both of those issues, and others related to stress, have abated.  Headaches are rare and while I still have GERD (thanks to a hiatal hernia), I am no longer keeping TUMS in business.  Clearly my social anxiety was at the heart of my stress issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;and-a-bit-of-adhd-didnt-help&#34;&gt;And, a Bit of ADHD Didn&amp;rsquo;t Help&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve known for some time that I have &amp;lsquo;controlled&amp;rsquo; ADHD.  What I mean by controlled is that over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve learned some coping strategies to help me manage some of the issues around ADHD.  I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, for example, how to focus for short periods of time on some task and, at the same time, how not to hyperfocus on tasks.  What do I mean by hyperfocus?  Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve been known to spend 16 - 18 hours a day working on a project, forgetting to eat, ignoring family, and so on because I was so focused in on what I was doing. But while I sometimes experience hyperfocus, I also have issues finishing projects that I start.  One of the key characteristics of an ADHD person is to become highly excited by a project then dig in, taking a project to, say, 80% complete, then losing interest.  That&amp;rsquo;s me.  It&amp;rsquo;s why I have at least two partial master&amp;rsquo;s degrees.  I got to a certain point and simply lost interest, distracted by some other new, shiny topic that captured my attention.  I have an FCC license as an amateur radio operator and spent a couple of thousand dollars on radios, though I don&amp;rsquo;t actually get on the radio (in fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t currently have any radios  set up for use.)  I hold an FAA certificate as a drone pilot, and own a drone though I seldom fly. I have photography and video equipment that sits idle because I became highly interested in those fields only to let them fall to the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ah-growing-up-adhd-before-adhd-was-a-thing&#34;&gt;Ah, Growing Up ADHD Before ADHD was a Thing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the 60&amp;rsquo;s and 70&amp;rsquo;s the concept of ADHD was not really well recognized.  I was a behavior problem in class.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish (or sometimes start) assignments. I forgot things.  I was easily distracted and occasionally disruptive in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some testing (who knows what kind since there was no testing for ADHD at the time), my high distractibility was attributed to boredom.  It was thought that I tended to grasp things quickly so that I became bored in the classroom.  Apparently they thought I was smart even though I was, and am, pretty average. But I also didn&amp;rsquo;t do well on the playground.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t make friends easily. I was a poor, mildly uncoordinated athlete, so I was always one of the last ones picked for teams. I was different, though exactly how, I can&amp;rsquo;t say (it&amp;rsquo;s been more than 50 years, you know!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lest you think that I am self-diagnosing (I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that shortly) I was actually professionally tested in the late 90&amp;rsquo;s, while in my mid-thirties, and officially diagnosed with ADHD, though I had  developed compensatory skills which lessened its impact on me. I think there was some hesitance in assigning that diagnosis, given the masking behaviors I had developed. Looking back, though, I think part of that hesitancy may have been that adult ADHD wasn&amp;rsquo;t well recognized. I was tested in 1997, just three years after ADHD was added to the DSM-III as a legitimate diagnosis for adults&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enter-the-spectrum&#34;&gt;Enter the Spectrum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more recent years I have come to realize that, in addition to ADHD,  I may be somewhere on the Autistic spectrum.  Why do I say that?  Well, let&amp;rsquo;s go back to that comment about hating social events.  The primary reason I hate social events is that I could never figure out how to interact with others, to make small talk.  Maintaining a conversation&amp;rsquo;s flow has always been a challenge. I struggled to read the social clues that others provide.  I was known for saying things that, to me, were reasonable but were, to others,  apparently insensitive or rude.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t intentional; I just didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize the problem.  Years of practice has led to some improvement in that area, but given the option to attend a social event or not, I&amp;rsquo;ll choose &amp;ldquo;not&amp;rdquo; every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole social avoidance thing was a conundrum for my ex-wife.  You see, I was working as a nurse and always interacted well with my patients.  My wife was confused because I could be quite outgoing with my patients, in contrast to other social scenarios. She wanted to go to parties and visit with people and all the other social things people do.  I generally refrained from going with her.  The reason, as I explained to her one time, is because the work environment is a stage.  I know the script, I know the bounds of the stage, I know the limits of the storyline.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about small talk, per se, because the situation defined the conversation. But, when I&amp;rsquo;m in an uncontrolled social situation, I don&amp;rsquo;t understand the rules.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know the limits and don&amp;rsquo;t have a script to follow.  I said this, by the way, in the presence of a counselor who clearly did not recognize the signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of wives and other relationships, I often failed to discern the needs and wants of others.  Well, that&amp;rsquo;s not exactly true. I could &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; discern their needs and wants, but not often.  As a consequence,  I tended to act on my own interests, without really being aware of others&amp;rsquo; interests. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily self-absorbed, though I think I came across that way, nor was I necessarily insensitive or uncaring.  I just honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what others needed.  To that end, gift giving was a challenge because I could never determine what my wife  or kids might want.  The choices I made, though well intentioned, were seldom met with much appreciation.  I actually warned my current wife that she would need to be specific in what she would like because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t in my wheelhouse to &amp;lsquo;devine&amp;rsquo; these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common trait of autism is sudden, intense bouts of anger. What many call meltdowns.  Well, that was me as a child and even today I struggle to deal with frustration without over reacting or becoming angry and even, at times, violent, though that violence is not aimed at people. My desk has taken quite a beating over the years, however. Anger is sometimes associated with the frustration of trying to manage multiple tasks.  That earlier evaluation noted exactly that type of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I dug into the topic, I learned &amp;lsquo;stimming&amp;rsquo; is a common behavior and can take many forms.  For me, this seems to be constant leg movements as well as picking at my skin, particularly my scalp.  This is actually a behavior that I had not associated with anything other than mindless responses to itching.  The problem being, of course, that I didn&amp;rsquo;t always itch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then let&amp;rsquo;s talk about impulse control. Although I am much better now, having developed some masking behaviors, I still have issues at times with impulse control.  What I mean is jumping into the middle of conversations, interrupting others, and so on while talking with others.  Doing things out of sequence or before they should be done because I&amp;rsquo;m impatient and want to get going.  Acting before thinking in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-first-inkling-that-something-wasnt-right&#34;&gt;My First Inkling that Something Wasn&amp;rsquo;t Right&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the issues I&amp;rsquo;ve related are seen in hindsight.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize them at the time, nor did anyone else, apparently.  It would be many, many years later before I really began to put the pieces together. And, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it at the time, perhaps the first hint that something was amiss was when, as a teenager I began working in a grocery store.  One day one of the guys I worked with asked my why I never looked him in the eye.  He noted that I always looked &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; his eyes as he pointed to his glabella (skin just above the nose where the eyebrows meet).  It was a behavior that I had not known I was doing.  Yet, the inability to look others in the eye is a common trait of ASD, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it at the time. Having him point it out to me, of course, made me conscious of it and I made a concerted effort to make eye contact. I still struggle with it sometimes, particularly with people I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what I know (I haven&amp;rsquo;t divulged &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; my secrets!) about myself and about autism, I suspect that I&amp;rsquo;m somewhere on the spectrum.  In fact, I recently took several online screening tests all of which suggested I seek professional help.  Now, I admit that having done some reading on the topic I have a general sense of what answers lead to that outcome and this may bias those tests.  Still, looking at my history and combining that with those assessments gives me a fairly good idea that my suspicion is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, am I self-diagnosing?  Yes. Do I believe I am autistic? Probably. Am I going to get tested so that I have an official diagnosis?  No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting an actual diagnosis, particularly as an older adult is both expensive and challenging.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had 60+ years of experience in developing compensatory mechanisms and masking behaviors for dealing with the challenges I face. As a healthcare provider and educator, I&amp;rsquo;ve also learned what the expected responses are, so, there&amp;rsquo;s some question as to how accurate any diagnostic testing would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-next-steps&#34;&gt;My Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to the point, what would be the benefit?  Will a diagnosis change how I do things?  Will it lead to some magical improvements?  The answer to those questions is &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;.  There&amp;rsquo;s no magic bullet to treat the issues.  It comes down to making a concerted effort to face those challenges and put myself in uncomfortable situations in order to develop those skills that are lacking.  Or, alternately, to embrace my difference and live my life in a way that is consistent with my needs and preferences so that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel anxious and stressed.  I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen, for the most part, this second path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why have I written this?  Well, mostly to explore my own thinking (which is the motivation for much of my writing) and to perhaps stimulate others to take a close look at themselves and their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Putting My Second Act Into Perspective</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/putting-my-second-act-into-perspective/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/putting-my-second-act-into-perspective/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;putting-my-second-act-into-perspective&#34;&gt;Putting My Second Act into Perspective&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months ago I retired after forty years of nursing practice.  One of the things I was told when I retired was that I would get bored within three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I told a former co-worker, I&amp;rsquo;m busier now than when I was working.  The difference is that I&amp;rsquo;m doing what interests me, what I want to do, rather than what I&amp;rsquo;m required to do by someone else.  I can work at my own pace rather than meeting &amp;lsquo;productivity&amp;rsquo; requirements.  Or worrying about performance appraisals, or playing the myriad corporate games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;putting-my-second-act-into-perspective&#34;&gt;Putting My Second Act into Perspective&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months ago I retired after forty years of nursing practice.  One of the things I was told when I retired was that I would get bored within three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I told a former co-worker, I&amp;rsquo;m busier now than when I was working.  The difference is that I&amp;rsquo;m doing what interests me, what I want to do, rather than what I&amp;rsquo;m required to do by someone else.  I can work at my own pace rather than meeting &amp;lsquo;productivity&amp;rsquo; requirements.  Or worrying about performance appraisals, or playing the myriad corporate games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an odd sense of finality to retiring.  You feel, in some ways, like your life is over.  The idea that time is limited creeps in. Does it make sense to start a business, a YouTube channel, a blog, given the time you have remaining?  You&amp;rsquo;re getting old.  What&amp;rsquo;s the point of going back to school to earn a new degree in a different field?  Who&amp;rsquo;s going to hire a 65 year old?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That odd sense of finality is odd because I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; old. Okay, my knees might disagree, but overall I feel pretty damn good.  I have lots of energy, am mentally acute, and ready for adventures. I&amp;rsquo;m ready to learn and do new things, to go places, have new experiences and all that.  Go to the beach and ogle the pretty young women in their beach wear?  Yes, please. Am I really three times their age?  Doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I look for new opportunities.  I write this blog.  I create videos that have not yet seen the light of day.  I earn my FAA certificate as a drone pilot.  I take pictures and build my skills as a photographer. I learn to see the world through the photographer&amp;rsquo;s lens.  I learn more about computers and videography and whatever else piques my interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I realize that I have, at least, another twenty years ahead of me.  When I was twenty, forty was far off in the distance.  I knew I would accomplish a great deal in those twenty years. And I did. I built a career (actually two), climbed the ladder, created a family, owned homes and cars and collected all the detritus of adult life. All in twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was forty, sixty seemed ages away. But in the twenty years from forty to sixty I built yet another career, this time in nursing education, earned two degrees, earned the respect of my colleagues and contributed to the growth of my university,  built a great life with a wonderful woman, and built a significant retirement savings balance which was essentially non-existent at age 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at all that I accomplished in each of those twenty year periods, why does thinking about twenty years into the future feel different at 65? Why is it hard to feel the same optimism about the next twenty that I felt in each of the last twenty year periods?  Why did I see possibilities in those earlier periods and perceive limitations in the upcoming twenty years? And yet I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t feel limited.  Seeing what I have accomplished in the past twenty years tells me that I can be just as successful, if not more successful, in the next twenty.  And I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who recognizes this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick internet search helps to identify many people whose major contributions to the world didn&amp;rsquo;t really begin until they were in the 50s, 60s, 70s, or even later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colonel Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken fame, for example, didn&amp;rsquo;t begin his chicken business until he was 65.  There are several writers who didn&amp;rsquo;t begin writing until their retirement, Laura Ingalls Wilder of Little House on the Prairie fame being one of them. The artist &amp;ldquo;Grandma Moses&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t begin painting until she was 78, yet she gained acclaim for her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia Child, the famous chef, didn&amp;rsquo;t write her first book until she was 50. Martha Stewart, too, was in her 50s when she found success as a chef and author.  She was 56 when she founded her media empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Roget was 73 when he published the first edition of Roget&amp;rsquo;s thesaurus.
Webster was 70 when he completed his dictionary of American Language. And there are many more examples of folks who begin successful second careers later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most interesting to me is Larry Finger.  Never heard of him?  Well, he&amp;rsquo;s the guy that got wireless networking working on Linux back in 2005.  While he had some background in programming, he knew nothing about Linux until he became a full-time Rver after retiring at age 65.  You can read more about him &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/larry-finger-linux-wireless-hero-was-a-persistent-patient-coder-and-mentor/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but the thing I want to focus on is that beginning at age 65 he taught himself enough about Linux that he would make more than 1500 contributions to the Linux kernel related to wireless networking between age 65 and his death at 84.  That&amp;rsquo;s not an insignificant bit of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that retiring from my primary career, even at the age of 65, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I sit back and wait for my body and mind to deteriorate and the grim reaper to call.  Now is the best time in my life to pursue the things that most interest me.  Now is the time to create a new career that reflects my interests and values rather than my need to pay the bills.  Maybe build my own brand and become an &amp;ldquo;influencer&amp;rdquo;.  Or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or go back to school for something new. Maybe IT.  Here in Georgia I can go back to college (again) for a degree in a different field paying only for the textbooks and other supplies.  Tuition for us &amp;ldquo;old folks&amp;rdquo; is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the perfect time to really explore my interests.  My income is no longer tied to work.  My bills get paid, even if my entrepreneurial efforts implode. This frees me to pursue myriad avenues and opportunities without worrying about paying the bills. And that&amp;rsquo;s the great thing about retiring.  I am excited to continue to explore my opportunities and see what the next twenty years hold for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using the Right Tool for the Job</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 18:13:48 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/using-the-right-tool-for-the-job/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the late 1980&amp;rsquo;s, when I first began working with computers, there were a fairly wide variety of devices and OSes from which to choose.  TRS-80, Commodore (I had the C-128), MS-Dos based PCs, Apple, Amiga, and so on.  The challenge was to determine which device worked best for your intended use.  DOS based PCs were best for office type work, Apple was the choice if you were doing multimedia, Amiga for gaming, etc.  While you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do anything on most of those devices, each had particular strengths and weaknesses.  The question you faced in making a purchase was, &amp;ldquo;which device is best for what I want to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Back in the late 1980&amp;rsquo;s, when I first began working with computers, there were a fairly wide variety of devices and OSes from which to choose.

DOS based PCs were best for office type work, Apple was the choice if you were doing multimedia, Amiga for gaming, etc.  While you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do anything on most of those devices, each had particular strengths and weaknesses.  The question you faced in making a purchase was, &amp;ldquo;which device is best for what I want to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure there were folks who asked why a particular device didn&amp;rsquo;t do &amp;ldquo;such-and-so&amp;rdquo; but, for the most part, it was understood that different platforms had different options. Despite having been adopted by businesses early on (Thanks, IBM) the MS-DOS PC didn&amp;rsquo;t have a spreadsheet program.  The first spreadsheet, VisiCalc, was introduced on the Apple, so if a business wanted to leverage that application, they invested in an Apple machine, they didn&amp;rsquo;t carp about VisiCalc not being available on the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the industry has pretty well consolidated in a way that blurs the lines between the various devices and their OSes.  Many of the manufacturers of computers have evaporated and their OSes have disappeared.  What remains are really three major  players (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux) and one minor player (BSD), along with a few &amp;ldquo;also rans&amp;rdquo; (Haiku, BeOS, etc). These are centered around two primary hardware platforms &amp;ndash; Apple, and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work primarily with Mac OS, though I also have numerous Linux and even BSD machines.  Linux and BSD are used for what they&amp;rsquo;re best suited for &amp;ndash; servers. My Mac OS devices are my daily drivers and what I use for web browsing, email, writing, tracking finances, etc. The Mac is also what I do video and photo editing on. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that I don&amp;rsquo;t do Linux (or BSD) desktop &amp;ndash; I do.  I just don&amp;rsquo;t currently use those desktops regularly. And the reason is rather mundane: the M2 Mac Mini is what sits on my desktop and my Intel Macbook Air (2020 model) is what lives in the living room for quick browsing when I&amp;rsquo;m not at my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do own a Windows 10 device, though it generally sits on a shelf, waiting to be turned on for those rare occasions when I have no other option because the software I need is only available on Windows (PlayOn TV, for example).   Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss my reasons for avoiding Windows at some later date. Or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I noted in an earlier post I have begun exploring FreeBSD.  Anytime you&amp;rsquo;re learning a new system, program, service, etc. you tend to peruse the forums and message boards for hints, tips, and answers to specific issues you encounter.  One of the topics that seems to come up frequently, not only on the BSD boards, but Linux, as well, is why a particular OS doesn&amp;rsquo;t support a particular device (wireless, printer, whatever) or piece of software.  There are folks that seem to think that Adobe ought to be available on Linux. Or Microsoft Office.  Or whatever specific piece of software they want.  And it&amp;rsquo;s a whine that I don&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the complaints I&amp;rsquo;ve read about FreeBSD is that it lacks certain &amp;ldquo;vital&amp;rdquo; pieces of software.  Of course what is &amp;ldquo;vital&amp;rdquo; to you may not be vital to me, so that whole complaint is a bit subjective. But, from what I&amp;rsquo;ve read there are some 28,000 programs available for FreeBSD.  Surely there&amp;rsquo;s a program in that bunch that will meet your needs.  Now, I admit that my needs are not that big, but I have had no problem locating and installing every application I need to do my daily work in either the packages or ports for FreeBSD. Scanning the ports lists, I am absolutely astonished at the wide range of applications that are available, including quite a few that I would consider rather arcane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the same complaint levied against various Linux distributions, along with complaints of difficulty in installing them.  These complaints generally come, it seems to me, from folks that are trying to move from Windows to Linux and expecting the exact same experience.  Reminds me of those House Hunter International folks that move from the US to Lithuania for the &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo; then complain that housing in Vilnius (the capital of Lithuania) is not the same as in the US.  The kitchen is smaller, the rooms are smaller, there is no oven, there&amp;rsquo;s no expansive yard, etc.  When you move to a different country, you should expect significant differences in how the people in your new home live and what conveniences are available.  That&amp;rsquo;s the experience you came to have. When you move to a different OS you should expect differences in how the systems work and what software is available.  If there were no differences then there would be no reason to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that kind of brings me back to my topic. If you&amp;rsquo;re wanting to get work done, you choose the best tool for the job.  You might be able to drive a nail in with a screwdriver, but it won&amp;rsquo;t be easy and it won&amp;rsquo;t be pretty.  You might be able to get your work done in Linux, but if your work relies on some specific software which is not available in Linux, then Linux is not the best tool for the job.  Stick with Windows.  Don&amp;rsquo;t whine that the Windows-only application &amp;ldquo;W&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is not available in Linux.  Stick with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you&amp;rsquo;re curious about Linux and want to see what applications are available or what Linux (or BSD) applications might be acceptable alternatives to Windows applications, by all means install and explore Linux (or BSD). Take your time. Explore widely and deeply.  You might just find that there is an alternative that is as good as, and perhaps better than, the Windows version.  Then you can jump out of Windows and into something more interesting, more challenging, and more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was gonna us &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; but since that&amp;rsquo;s now the new name of Twitter, the argument didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Then you can jump out of Windows and into something more interesting, more challenging, and more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;driving-a-hybrid-pickup-truck&#34;&gt;Driving a Hybrid Pickup Truck&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drove a 2000 Ford Ranger for over 20 years.  I loved that truck and basically just wore it out.  I think when I finally sold it in 2021 I had put over 250K miles on it.  But, alas, all good things come to an end and as it got longer in the tooth it began to have more problems, with their associated costs, than I was willing to deal with.  So, having two other vehicles in our house I decided to sell my favorite vehicle of all time. For two years, then, I did not have a truck and, by and large, didn&amp;rsquo;t find that I needed one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;driving-a-hybrid-pickup-truck&#34;&gt;Driving a Hybrid Pickup Truck&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drove a 2000 Ford Ranger for over 20 years.  I loved that truck and basically just wore it out.  I think when I finally sold it in 2021 I had put over 250K miles on it.  But, alas, all good things come to an end and as it got longer in the tooth it began to have more problems, with their associated costs, than I was willing to deal with.  So, having two other vehicles in our house I decided to sell my favorite vehicle of all time. For two years, then, I did not have a truck and, by and large, didn&amp;rsquo;t find that I needed one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we moved.  And our new house had lots of work to be done in the yard.  Now, we have an open trailer that can be used for hauling things, and we turned to it quite a bit but sometimes the trailer seemed overkill for what we needed to haul.  A truck would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, working from home for the last ten years meant that I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of driving anyway and when my wife retired and we were both at home, having two cars just seemed redundant and an unnecessary cost.  I mean I was putting only about 3K miles on my car every year. So, I sold my second car. And we got along okay for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with my wife on the road more to visit family (being retired gave her more time to do those sorts of things) I often found myself at home with no means for getting about.  I needed a car.  And, since we were still doing quite a bit of work in the yard, a truck made sense.  So, truck shopping we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first choice, of course, was another Ranger.  But they&amp;rsquo;ve grown up a bit over time.  For what I needed they seemed to be overkill.  Then I found the Maverick.  Great reviews, perfect size for my needs. And, a bit challenging to get at the time (October 2023). But I happened across a brand new Maverick Hybrid.  Hybrid technologies had intrigued me for quite some time.  I liked the idea of higher MPG as the vehicle switches between the gas engine and electric motors.  The downside, of course, is that the hauling capacity is slightly lower, but given that I rarely haul more than a few hundred pounds that would not likely be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I ponied up a bit more money for what I hope will be lower overall operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that has absolutely fascinated me is the smooth transition between the electric motor and the gas engine.  Unless I&amp;rsquo;m pay really close attention to the sounds of the vehicle, or am looking at the dashboard that shows when the vehicle is in electric mode, I cannot tell when the engine kicks in or when it drops back to the electric motor.  How does it do that? I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; heard the engine actually crank, as it always starts in electric mode and transitions when it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I did a bit of digging to learn how it can make that transition so seamlessly.  I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woBvHw4VYGE&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; really interesting video and learned a lot about the eCVT transmission and the electric motor aspects of vehicle along with the whole regenerative braking thing that recharges the Lithium Ion battery.  From another site (which I don&amp;rsquo;t remember) I learned that the computer in hybrid engines monitor the crankshaft position so that the pistons are positioned to provide optimal conditions for starting.  From what I understand the  eCVT simply transfers power from the wheels to the engine, causing it to turn the crankshaft which, in turn, starts the engine running .  No starter is really even needed!  It&amp;rsquo;s actually a pretty ingenious design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do I like the truck after 4500 miles?  I mostly love it.  I wish the bed was a bit bigger (4.5 feet just doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite allow from carrying some things). And the backseat is a bit tight, though my 11 year old grand daughter has no problem with it.  Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;m happy with my purchase. It is a comfortable drive (though I do miss sitting up a bit higher as you do in most pickups) and handles well.  And my latest fill-up showed 40.5 MPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I sometimes wish I had bought the Ranger?  Sure, but mostly for nostalgia rather than any practical reason.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;doing-unix-y-things&#34;&gt;Doing Unix-y Things&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/my-history-with-self-hosting/&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; I noted that my foray into Linux began when I started an intensive program in network administration, etc  back in 2000.  That&amp;rsquo;s not precisely true.  That course did not teach me &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; about Linux.  I don&amp;rsquo;t even recall it being mentioned.  What it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; teach me was Unix.  Sun Solaris Unix, to be precise, running on a Sun Sparc server (rest their souls). Linux came along a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;doing-unix-y-things&#34;&gt;Doing Unix-y Things&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/my-history-with-self-hosting/&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; I noted that my foray into Linux began when I started an intensive program in network administration, etc  back in 2000.  That&amp;rsquo;s not precisely true.  That course did not teach me &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; about Linux.  I don&amp;rsquo;t even recall it being mentioned.  What it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; teach me was Unix.  Sun Solaris Unix, to be precise, running on a Sun Sparc server (rest their souls). Linux came along a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember, even today, our introduction to the commandline.  I don&amp;rsquo;t really know why, but that black screen, devoid of anything other than a dollar sign and a blinking cursor reminded me of some bottomless pit.  It seemed the whole internet universe was opened up and I was staring into the abyss.  It was a weird feeling.  And, I got over it pretty quick. And I wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that I was intrigued by Unix. The problem was Unix at that time was not cheap and required specific &amp;ndash; and expensive &amp;ndash; hardware. Now a couple of my classmates were rather competent at the commandline and introduced (I should say re-introduced) me to Linux. Unlike that time around 1995 when I got a Linux disk in some PC magazine, popped the floppy disk into the drive, fired up the computer and stared at a blank screen with no idea what to do next, this time I had some inkling of what to do at the commandline. In fact, I felt fairly confident in those unix-y things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for the next twenty or so years I&amp;rsquo;ve bounced around the Linux world trying out various distros, figuring out how to do what I wanted to do, and how to make things happen.  I&amp;rsquo;ve said a lot of bad words along the way and threw more than one item across the room in frustration. But I learned. And I continue to learn.  Sometimes I amaze myself at how much I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. Am I an expert&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;? Not by any means. but, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty damn confident in getting things done, or at least knowing where to look to get the answers. All that said, in truth, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly stumbled through my efforts to get a handle on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I revisited an old friend. Unix.  In the form of FreeBSD.  Now, to be legal, I must say that FreeBSD is not Unix.  It is Unix-like.  Why? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opengroup.org/&#34;&gt;The Open Group&lt;/a&gt; owns the trademark to Unix. They set the standards and provide certification for Unix systems and, therefore, they get to say which systems can call themselves Unix. Systems, such as FreeBSD, which function almost identically to Unix (and that pretty much include Linux, too, I suppose) may say they&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;Unix-like&amp;rdquo; but cannot use the actual title of Unix.  Potayto, potahto, in my view. I imagine there&amp;rsquo;s some serious money mixed in there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSD experience is both quite familiar and quite different from the Linux experience.  It&amp;rsquo;s familiar because much of the work is done at the commandline and the commands are generally the same.  On the other hand, there are generally fewer problems with getting software to work in BSD because the entire system is designed to work cohesively.  There&amp;rsquo;s a handful of programmers that oversee the entire process and only software packages that are fully compliant with the overall design find their way into the ecosystem. BSD systems (yes, there are several) each have specific philosophical approaches and they adhere quite tightly to those approaches.  In short, they don&amp;rsquo;t try to be everything to everybody. They try to tailor their systems to the needs of specific groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because BSDs are more focused, their individual markets are smaller which, in turn, means that fewer programs tend to be developed for a given system.  And this is where BSD really diverges from Linux.  Linux, being a more generalized system, and having thousands more users, has literally thousands of applications&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that will run on that platform (though not without significant issues at times, it must be noted).  And part of that is the draw of Linux. Versatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux powers a lot of servers on the internet.  So does Unix.  In fact, some of the pretty big names on the internet, such as Netflix, use FreeBSD.  The challenge for me is that there are dozens of flavors of Linux, each with their unique take on what is important and how to go about getting things done.  That&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily bad but it does make working on different systems a bit challenging.  And, at least from my point of view, doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, back to the topic at hand.  Why did I decide to revisit Unix?  I wanted to revisit those roots.  I wanted to recall what the true Unix experience is about. I wanted to add to my knowledge base and understanding of operating systems And, I was curious if I could run all the things I&amp;rsquo;m now doing on my linux devices on a BSD system.  The jury is still out on that, by the way, as I&amp;rsquo;m still learning and playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than take a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants, also known as a learn-by-screwing-up, approach I decided to actually take the time to learn, in a more or less systematic manner, the BSD system.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://mwl.io&#34;&gt;Michael W Lucas&lt;/a&gt; has written a great book on FreeBSD called &lt;em&gt;Absolute FreeBSD&lt;/em&gt;.  I have to admit that it is probably the single most easily read and digested tech books I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. And I&amp;rsquo;ve read a bunch of them.  I&amp;rsquo;m only about half-way through the book at this point but already I have a much clearer understanding of a lot of concepts that I was aware of but didn&amp;rsquo;t fully understand.  And, because both FreeBSD and Linux share that common Unix foundation, much (but not all) that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is transferable to the Linux environment.  I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do a book review on this one when I&amp;rsquo;m done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the Unix-y way of doing things.  I like the philosophy that underlies the BSDs. And, I like the knowledge that there are no corporate overlords looking for ways to squeeze more money out of my pocket.  I mean, I read recently that Microsoft is looking at including ads in the start menu. Seriously?  And, I like the fact that the data on my computer, sitting in my office, is confined to my office.  No one is trying to get me to store my data in the cloud (OneDrive, anyone? Oh, and Google, what can I say?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSDs are run by volunteers and not-for-profit organizations rather than corporations.  They are not out to make a gazillion dollars for their stockholders while screwing their customers. And they&amp;rsquo;re not turning their customers into the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I kinda like all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remind me sometime to tell you about my response to the question, &amp;ldquo;do you consider yourself an expert&amp;rdquo; as posed by one of my dissertation professors.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need all those thousands of applications?  How many of them are just tweaks to earlier programs?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Why Do People Use Chromeos</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-do-people-use-chromeos&#34;&gt;Why Do People Use ChromeOS?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like people have jumping on the ChromeOS bandwagon in droves since the first Chromebooks debuted in 2011.  The draw, as I understand it, was that the laptops were small and inexpensive and required little knowledge of computing.  Boot it up, create a Google account (if you didn&amp;rsquo;t already have one), and go.  Schools and even businesses bought into the ecosystem quickly.  Today many schools are almost entirely connected using Chromebooks and often students are given a Chromebook for them to take home and use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-do-people-use-chromeos&#34;&gt;Why Do People Use ChromeOS?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like people have jumping on the ChromeOS bandwagon in droves since the first Chromebooks debuted in 2011.  The draw, as I understand it, was that the laptops were small and inexpensive and required little knowledge of computing.  Boot it up, create a Google account (if you didn&amp;rsquo;t already have one), and go.  Schools and even businesses bought into the ecosystem quickly.  Today many schools are almost entirely connected using Chromebooks and often students are given a Chromebook for them to take home and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;rsquo;t understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back in the day, before personal computers were a thing, computers were generally mainframes that individual users accessed via a dumb terminal or thin client.  Little to no actual processing occurred on the terminal and nothing was stored locally.  According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromeOS&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; this was also the model used for the original ChromeOS &amp;ndash; the laptop was nothing more than a thin client that connected the server using a traditional server-client model.  While that model has evolved over time, the reality is that it is still, by and large, a client-sever model where most of the computing activity and storage occurs.  For a time, Google encouraged developers to create apps that would run on the limited OS. However, that activity has subsided and the move now is to &amp;ldquo;Web Applications&amp;rdquo; where everything is through the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be fair, if a user&amp;rsquo;s primary need for a computer is to surf the web, check email, and write an occasional document, ChromeOS is fine.  Google&amp;rsquo;s office suite is not bad and is, for most people, quite sufficient. Where I start running into problems is with the limitations of web apps, the ridiculous cost of the hardware relative to what it provides, and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk, first, about the hardware.  ChromeOS requires little processing power on the user&amp;rsquo;s end.  Generally speaking, it only needs to generate a webpage. This uses very little processing power.  Even with web apps that are heavily weighed down with JavaScript neither processing power nor memory are issues. Even the most minimal computer should easily be able to handle the load.  Yet, a quick visit to Best Buy shows that Chromebooks range in price from $169 US to $699 US.  Those higher end machines tend to have specs that simply aren&amp;rsquo;t needed for ChromeOS.  What gives?  I mean, do you really need an Intel i5 Ultra processor with 8 GB ram and a 256GB hard drive on a device that does almost all of its work in a browser and saves the results of that work in the cloud?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in fairness, those machines apparently are designed to run not just ChromeOS but to also allow you to run Linux apps on the device, though you have to jump through some hoops to make that happen.  Once upon a time more processing power, more memory, and more storage was a good thing, particularly when using Microsoft Windows.  But that is not really needed with Chrome.  It seems that manufacturers recognized that the &amp;ldquo;more, more, more&amp;rdquo; mindset still influences user&amp;rsquo;s buying decisions and so are building and selling machines that simply don&amp;rsquo;t need that much capacity but which generate more revenue for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern I have with ChromeOS is that all Chrome devices have an expiration date.  That&amp;rsquo;s right.  Depending on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en&#34;&gt;machine&lt;/a&gt; ChromeOS will no longer receive updates for the OS.  That means that, among other things, while Google touts the security benefits of the OS, once that device has expired it will no longer get that benefit. Now, you might argue that Microsoft and Apple do the same thing and, to some degree, that is true.  But if I buy a new Windows computer two months before a new version of the OS comes out, I can generally upgrade my OS to that new version for free and I will then have the same benefits of every other user of the new version.  That has generally been true of Mac, as well, so long as they don&amp;rsquo;t change the actual hardware (e.g. moving from Intel to their own silicon).  But, if I unknowingly buy a Chromebook that expires in three months, well, I&amp;rsquo;m just SOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really see why that is necessary given that you&amp;rsquo;re talking about an OS that runs little more than a web browser.  Just seems very arbitrary to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to another area that I&amp;rsquo;m just scratching my head over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago the school system that my wife worked for moved to Chromebooks.  Their rational was that it was training students in the use of technology so that they are better positioned to transfer those skills into the workforce. Huh?  By far the majority of businesses rely on Microsoft Office products to conduct business.  Microsoft Office does not run on Chromebooks, so are you really teaching students how to be successful in that environment?  And, what about teaching programming?  It ain&amp;rsquo;t happening on a Chromebook!  The OS simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide the environment for proper programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important, too, to remember that everything you do on a Chromebook is sent to Google.  All of your Documents are stored in their cloud.  While they &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; to be a highly secure environment, &lt;a href=&#34;../i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure&lt;/a&gt;.  Do you really want your financials and health information stored on Google&amp;rsquo;s servers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, stop and think about this for just a minute.  You buy, let&amp;rsquo;s say, that $169 chromebook from Best Buy, you create a google account and then begin using their OS and their storage for all their documents.  According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/chromebook-plus-education/#:~:text=Chromebooks%20are%20used%20by%2050,research%20centers%20and%20collaboration%20hubs.&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; some 50 MILLION students use chromebooks.  That is a TON of storage and a TON of bandwidth that is needed to support those users. And that doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the millions of other business  and individual users.  And yet, there is no cost for that service. No business is going to give away that much of their resources for free.  So, how does Google benefit from this?  I don&amp;rsquo;t have a definitive answer but I have my suspicions. And I&amp;rsquo;ll bet they&amp;rsquo;re the same as yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I come back to, &amp;ldquo;why do people use ChromeOS&amp;rdquo;.  I tried it briefly but didn&amp;rsquo;t find it terribly useful so, for me, I&amp;rsquo;ll stick with my Mac, Linux, and BSD machines where I can actually do what I want to do, my way (generally) without the arbitrary limitations of web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving from Exchange to Zoho Mail</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/moving-from-exchange-to-zoho-mail/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;moving-from-exchange-to-zoho-mail&#34;&gt;Moving from Exchange to Zoho Mail&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere back around 2011 or 2012 I moved from my ISP&amp;rsquo;s email service to Microsoft Office 365 Business plan that offered access to MS Exchange server.  I had previously toyed with using Gmail&amp;rsquo;s services with my own domain name but didn&amp;rsquo;t find that it met my specific needs.  Too, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t have a great love for Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My motivation for moving, as I recall now more than a dozen years later, is that I was starting my doctoral studies and needed to be able to coordinate more easily with classmates, access calendars and documents across multiple platforms, and generally have better control over my workflows.  I was already using Microsoft Office for my word processing and spreadsheet needs, and was looking for an integrated solution that would allow me to plan and execute my work more easily.  After playing around with several solutions I finally settled on Office 365.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Some folks might argue that using Gmail&amp;rsquo;s free service (which at the time allowed the use of personal domain name without incurring an additional cost) made more sense than spending money on O365.  I saw it differently.  First, there&amp;rsquo;s the old mantra that if it&amp;rsquo;s free then you&amp;rsquo;re the product and there was some question (at least in my mind) about the security and privacy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why/&#34;&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt;.  An issue that I still feel is valid today.  Second, I was already using MS Word for my writing and rather than write in Google Docs then convert to .docx, it made more sense to use MS Word and save my documents to the Sharepoint site that was included in my O365 account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I was not terribly keen on paying upwards of $60 a year for email but when I took a step back, I realized that the benefits I got from using O365 made the cost at least reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s fast-forward to 2024.  I completed my doctorate in 2018. With the degree behind me and my employer providing an O365 account for most of my work, I no longer really needed my personal O365 account.  Inertia, more than anything else, kept me from switching away.  I had thousands of emails tucked away in my email account and several hundred documents stored in Sharepoint.  Moving all of that stuff was, it seemed, a daunting task.  So, I just let it sit and paid the annual costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, 2023, though, I retired and started taking a good look at what I was using.  I realized pretty quickly that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using essentially any of the services offered by O365 beyond email and that was mostly junk mail.  Why was I paying $60/ year for that service?  Beside, over time the offerings that came with what was initially called &amp;ldquo;Business Essentials&amp;rdquo; were degraded with fewer and fewer services offered at that tier.  The cost/benefit just wasn&amp;rsquo;t there. So, I began looking for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the considerations was the amount of available storage for emails and attachments. I took a look at my O365 mail storage usage and realized that I had accumulated less than 1.5 GB of email storage over a  10 year period.  I knew that even a small storage application would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at a variety of services, including some very popular, privacy oriented services such as ProtonMail, GMX, Mail.com, and several others. Overall, the costs for these services were not that much different from what I was already paying and the didn&amp;rsquo;t provide the same benefits as O365 so there was really no incentive to move to any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even considered simply using my extant iCloud+ account which allows you to include a custom domain for your email.  Since I was already paying for iCloud+ that would have seemed the logical choice.  The issue there is that your &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:me@icloud.com&#34;&gt;me@icloud.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:me@me.com&#34;&gt;me@me.com&lt;/a&gt;, and your custom domain email all get dumped into one pot.  I use my iCloud email as something of a filter when I need to sign up or provide an email address for a service or site that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I trust.  This way my legitimate mail and my &amp;lsquo;junk&amp;rsquo; email has a bit of separation.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t want everything dumped in one bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing a bit more research, I found Zoho Mail. Doing a bit of research, I found that Zoho has been around since 1996, is based in India, has several locations around the world, including Texas in the US, and has a full suite of business applications.  As of 2022, it had more than 80 million users, including some big names like Amazon, Netflix, Nike, etc &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  This was not fly-by-night operation that was likely to go belly-up anytime soon and, moreover, has demonstrated that it is a trustworthy operation in terms of security. Now the site is, to me, a bit confusing. But for a mere $1.25 (that&amp;rsquo;s a dollar and a quarter!) a month you get full business level email with 10GB storage, well beyond my needs for the foreseeable future.  From everything I can find out, it is as secure as O365.  I made my decision!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I was dreading was moving from one service to another.  However, Zoho provides a process for doing that which is simple and works fairly quickly.  Overall the process took maybe an hour to complete and when it was done I had all of my emails from my O365 account now in my Zohomail account, and was appropriately accessing the account using my custom domain name&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  I waited a few weeks before deactivating my O365 account. This allowed me to ensure that everything was working as it should be and that I had downloaded from my Sharepoint site all that I wanted and deleted the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;rsquo;m quite satisfied with Zoho as my mail provider.  The service is responsive, secure, does a good job of filtering spam and even sorts mail into various buckets e.g. newsletters, notifications, etc. My email clients have no problems connecting to the service and I&amp;rsquo;ve had not issues with mail I send being rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kgcrmsolutions.com/10-companies-using-zoho-crm/&#34;&gt;https://kgcrmsolutions.com/10-companies-using-zoho-crm/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have to update my DNS records with my registrar in order to use my custom domain with my new email provider.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>My History with Self Hosting</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/my-history-with-self-hosting/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/my-history-with-self-hosting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-history-with-self-hosting&#34;&gt;My History with Self-Hosting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey with Linux started in the summer of 2020 when I enrolled in an intensive course in IT designed for a specific ISP (which no longer exists). The course was provide through a state university in cooperation with that company and in conjunction with a state level push to encourage&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; tech companies to settle in Georgia.  I ended up not taking a job with that company. While was at the top of my class, the company decided not to extend an employment offer to me and so I moved on.  In retrospect, I think that was probably a good decision and the guys that were in the class with me all left that company and, honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where most of them landed.  Despite that, the class was still one of the most exciting and fulfilling experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had. And, I left it with fairly sound skillsets in networking, programming (C and Perl, primarily), web development and graphics (which I still suck at).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-history-with-self-hosting&#34;&gt;My History with Self-Hosting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey with Linux started in the summer of 2020 when I enrolled in an intensive course in IT designed for a specific ISP (which no longer exists). The course was provide through a state university in cooperation with that company and in conjunction with a state level push to encourage&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; tech companies to settle in Georgia.  I ended up not taking a job with that company. While was at the top of my class, the company decided not to extend an employment offer to me and so I moved on.  In retrospect, I think that was probably a good decision and the guys that were in the class with me all left that company and, honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where most of them landed.  Despite that, the class was still one of the most exciting and fulfilling experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had. And, I left it with fairly sound skillsets in networking, programming (C and Perl, primarily), web development and graphics (which I still suck at).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the intervening 24 years I&amp;rsquo;ve played with a lot of Linux computers and done a lot of interesting things. It was very shortly after completing that program that I begin self-hosting.  In those early days most of the sites where of the CMS variety &amp;ndash; Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla, MediaWiki, Dokuwiki, PHP-Fusion, PHP-Nuke, and the list goes on.  The challenge was that most of these required direct installation which almost invariably led to hours of trying to sort out the failed dependencies, troubleshoot a ton of issues and, in the end, nuking all that work for one reason or another.  While I absolutely loved learning about these different systems and enjoyed the challenge, in the end I really found that most of them were simply overkill for what I needed.  So, why did I do it?  Because I was curious about what made each system different and found the challenge itself fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;down-the-self-hosting-rabbit-hole&#34;&gt;Down the Self-Hosting Rabbit Hole&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last five or so years, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved in different directions.  Rather than manually installing all of these different systems, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved toward newer technologies that make the process easier and allow me to try different things to find what works best for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;yunohost-and-sandstorm&#34;&gt;Yunohost and Sandstorm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the earliest packaged system was something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://yunohost.org&#34;&gt;Yunohost&lt;/a&gt;. According to their website, Yunohost was created in 2012.  I probably installed my first version of it around 2014 or 2015 when I first starting futzing around with the Raspberry Pi. Yunohost, it seemed, was the perfect pairing to the RPI.  Along about the same time, I looked at &lt;a href=&#34;https://sandstorm.io&#34;&gt;Sandstorm&lt;/a&gt; which debuted in 2014. Both products do similar things &amp;ndash; making it easy to install web server apps on your local system.  Both had extensive app lists from which you could choose. The cool thing about both of these was that you were able to fairly easily install an app, see how it worked, see what uses you might have for it and, if it didn&amp;rsquo;t excite you, easily blow it away.  The downside, of course, is there were fewer problems with the installs which eliminated some of the &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; of learning and installing software 😀.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ansible-nas&#34;&gt;Ansible-NAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time I&amp;rsquo;ve expanded my computer stable from one desktop, one laptop, one server, and a couple of RPIs, to about a half dozen servers. This gave me the opportunity to muck around with Linux Desktop and to use &amp;ldquo;development&amp;rdquo; servers for play while not really disrupting the installations that I actually used.   As I did this I ran across another intriguing process option &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ansible-nas.io&#34;&gt;Ansible NAS&lt;/a&gt; by David Stephens.  Whereas Yunohost and Sandstorm provided a GUI that allowed you to see the list of available apps and descriptions of what the apps did, Ansible-NAS used an Ansible script to set up your server and install the desired applications. To use it, you needed to learn a bit about YAML and how to edit Ansible scripts. I was back in my element of having to learn and figure crap out to make it work!  I loved Ansible-NAS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through mucking around with Ansible-NAS I started learning bits and piece of ansible.  Many of the scripts used in Ansible-NAS were based on work by Jeff Geerling, a fellow with a rather interesting resume.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeffgeerling.com&#34;&gt;GeerlingGuy&lt;/a&gt; authored a book on Ansible that I&amp;rsquo;ve only fairly recently starting studying.  I also follow his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@JeffGeerling&#34;&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; as he does quite a bit with the Raspberry pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;then-came-docker&#34;&gt;Then came Docker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thirst to learn more, though, led me to Docker.  My early efforts with this technology was somewhat &amp;hellip; challenging.  I spent some time learning how to create docker-compose files and explored DockerHub but overall found the experience more confusing than anything else. Maybe that was because, as I recall, Docker didn&amp;rsquo;t work well on the RPI at the time which was the only linux device I had available and Docker basically sucked on Windows and Mac (at least that&amp;rsquo;s as I recall it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the early setback with Docker, I persisted and today I have somewhere in the neighborhood of two dozen docker containers running on two servers.  These containers provide everything from monitoring my IP cameras, to a Wordpress blog, a photography site, Calibre-web, my cloudflared instance, Jellyfin, and a host of other useful applications. The advent of management systems such as Portainer made managing the docker containers easier and accelerated my implementation of applications in Docker. Not all of the applications I use are in docker containers, however.  As I continued to play around with these newer technologies I ran into two other products that I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like: ProxMox and Unraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proxmox-and-unraid-arrive-on-the-scene&#34;&gt;Proxmox and Unraid Arrive on the Scene&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Proxmox] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://proxmox.com/en/&#34;&gt;https://proxmox.com/en/&lt;/a&gt;) was first on the scene for me.  I was intrigued by an OS that provided an overarching management structure for creating virtual machines, LXC containers, and general NAS type storage. In fact, while I had played with virtual machines for years through VirtualBox and VMWare, that was all done on my desktop system and while VMs were great for testing and playing with various distributions, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see a lot of utility for daily use.  Proxmox, though, suddenly made the creation of VMs not only easy but quite useful. All of my docker containers running on the Proxmox box are running inside a VM.  When I&amp;rsquo;m learning something new, or testing out an new OS or whatever, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to spin up a VM knowing that if I bork it, well, I just delete that VM and start over. No harm, no foul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was delving into Proxmox, I also ran across &lt;a href=&#34;https://unraid.net&#34;&gt;Unraid&lt;/a&gt;.  Unraid provides similar functionality to Proxmox with a few differences.  There are three primary differences between the two products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First is that while Proxmox is open source and free to use, Unraid has a free trial but does require a purchase in order to continue using the product past the trial period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, Unraid runs from a thumbdrive rather than from a hard drive.  As I understand it, once loaded, there is little to no activity on the boot disk (thumbdrive) so the thumbdrive allows you to use all of your storage disks for data rather than dedicating some or all of a drive to the OS.  That&amp;rsquo;s a nice feature!  And, because my HP Microserver has an internal USB port, I can use that for my boot disk and don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it being dislodged or lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, Unraid provides a host of applications that have presumably been optimized for the Unraid system that can generally be installed with a single click.  I believe that all of these apps are docker images, though I cannot be sure of that. Unraid also provides a variety of plugins that can be accessed from the web GUI.  If Proxmox has a similar feature, I haven&amp;rsquo;t found it. (But, then again, I also haven&amp;rsquo;t had a need for plugins, either.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stand now, I have two machines,  an HP Gen10 Plus Microserver and a repurposed HP EliteDesk, acting as servers on my network.  The HP hosts the Unraid server and the EliteDesk hosts the Proxmox server.  Yes, I could probably consolidate everything onto one server. And, yes, it might be wiser to run Proxmox on one machine and have a second Proxmox as a backup / fallback device.  But for now, I&amp;rsquo;m happy with my current setup and they allow me some choice in where applications are hosted and expand my storage capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-running-where&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Running, Where?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxmox:
LXCs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adguard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;motioneye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shaarli&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vaultwarden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wireguard (shut down at the moment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;omada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bookstack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tillium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dokuwiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tailscale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QEMU (VMs):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu server &amp;ndash; docker server with these containers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calibre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calibre-web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cloudflared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flame (a dashboard)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jellyfin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;joplin sync server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KIWIX (this is a cool off-line Wikipedia and other server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navidrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;portainer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uptime-kuma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wallabag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are QEMUs but are generaly turned off unless I have specific need for them:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Unraid server:
VMS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spin up vms here as needed when I&amp;rsquo;m exploring something that does not have a docker image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker containers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agent-DVR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apacheGuacamole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calibre (testing version)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calibre-web (testing version)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excalidraw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freshrss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gitea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grav (local version of this website)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homebridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MariaDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB (used for testing and will likely be nuked)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;phpmyadmin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;postgres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;raneto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shinobi-pro-cctv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StirlingPDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;webtop (toying with this one for now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wekan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wordpress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see I muck around with a lot of stuff. And I&amp;rsquo;m still looking, exploring and adding new stuff along the way.  The one advantage (?) of Unraid is that the App store makes it easy to find new applications to install and explore.  More often than not, I&amp;rsquo;ll install something, play with it a bit, then delete it, but sometimes I find something new and useful that becomes part of my everyday workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I say?  I love playing with technology!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PlainText Preferences</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/plaintext-preference/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/plaintext-preference/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;plaintext-preferences&#34;&gt;PlainText Preferences&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last ten years there have been a couple of preferences that have driven many of my technology decisions.  One is a preference for using plain text rather than proprietary software. The other is a preference for flat files over databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-talk-about-plain-text&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk about Plain Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My move toward plain text came about for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I just wanted to take notes that I could quickly create and reference as needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;plaintext-preferences&#34;&gt;PlainText Preferences&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last ten years there have been a couple of preferences that have driven many of my technology decisions.  One is a preference for using plain text rather than proprietary software. The other is a preference for flat files over databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-talk-about-plain-text&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk about Plain Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My move toward plain text came about for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I just wanted to take notes that I could quickly create and reference as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I  wanted to be able to focus on writing, such as an essay or blog post, without worrying really about formatting, etc.  What more distraction-free writing environment is there than the command line?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I wanted small, easily accessed files.  None of the proprietary word processors come close to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, I wanted to be able to do access and edit the files on any device I happen to be on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, I wanted them to be available 20 years from now (why I&amp;rsquo;ll still need them at age 85, who knows, but still &amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that all may sound nice, you say, but is it really practical?  I think so, particularly with the advent of Markdown.  Markdown allows me to provide some basic formatting as I write (think section headings) while minimizing the cruft.  The fact is, if I need to put a document into a particular format, let&amp;rsquo;s say Microsoft Word, I just need to copy and paste the plain text into the word processor and I&amp;rsquo;m off to the races.  On the other hand, trying to get a clean copy of that document &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of Word &amp;hellip; well, good luck with that.  The point is I can use &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; processing software to pretty up my work while keeping a clean copy available for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;and-then-there-are-flat-files&#34;&gt;And Then There Are Flat Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely allied with plain text files is the use of flat files.  I have come to prefer flat files for pretty much the same reason I like plain text &amp;ndash; easy of access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, full disclosure, I spent quite a bit of time over the last 24 years learning databases. I have created and managed many, many databases over that time and absolutely have nothing against them, per se. In the right environment and the right data they are phenomenal and, of course, are the best choice.  For my personal needs, though, databases seem to be overkill.  The right tool for the right job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing data in a database is very useful with large datasets.  In fact, it is really about the only way to work with very large datasets.  Storing my writing in a database, though, poses several issues. The first, obviously, is that the use of a database program to store a file makes little sense.  It adds an unnecessary level of complexity and creates an opportunity for failure.  More importantly, if the database should become corrupted the I lose all of my work.  Not an appetizing prospect.  Again, given the small quantity of work I do, the complexity and bulk of a database is simply overkill.  Running a database to store even one hundred blog posts is more work than needed.  To me, though, the most important reason is that to get my work out of the database requires a lot of extra effort.  If, for example,  I decide to move to a different computer, or a different web server, or use a different blogging platform, transitioning from one database system to another is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat files allow me to bypass that complexity and have everything I need easily available.  The order of the day, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already guessed is to minimize friction in my workflow.  The less complex, the better.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t get much simpler than a simple plain text file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my current workflow is to use Obsidian to write my notes, blog posts, etc. Obsidian saves all my files as simple flat files in plain text.  I copy those files over to my web folder where I run my Static Site Generator&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to create my website, then rsync those files up to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of evaluating which SSG to use.  I want my website to be static, as well with minimal extra stuff (think &lt;a href=&#34;https://brutalist-web.design&#34;&gt;Brutalist Web Design&lt;/a&gt;) so I&amp;rsquo;m looking around to see what fits me best.  I&amp;rsquo;m leaning toward either Hugo or MkDocs right now. But that is subject to change!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Confusing Fiction with Fact</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;confusing-fiction-with-fact&#34;&gt;Confusing Fiction with Fact&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I swear some people can&amp;rsquo;t keep track of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While browsing Amazon for something to read in the vein of philosophy I ran across a book entitled &lt;em&gt;The da Vinci Fraud: Why the Truth is Stranger than Fiction&lt;/em&gt; by Robert M. Price.  The book purports to debunk the &amp;ldquo;many misleading claims found in Dan Brown&amp;rsquo;s Da Vinci Code&amp;rdquo; according to one reviewer.  That statement and several others made by various &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;reviewers suggest that somehow Brown was intending to provide accurate historical information regarding the Christian Church.  Funny, having read &lt;em&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/em&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t recall Brown ever claiming that the book was historically accurate.  For someone to take the time to write a book to refute claims that were never made seems, well, stupid. Apparently, Mr. Price (or I should say Doctor Price, given his PhD) has difficulty comprehending that fiction is by definition not fact.  Fiction writers often base their works on some variation of an idea or concept and follow the &amp;ldquo;what if&amp;rdquo; process. That is, &amp;ldquo;what if&amp;rdquo; there really is an Opus Dei &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with sinister underpinnings?  &amp;ldquo;What if&amp;rdquo; Jesus and Mary Magdalene really did have a child together? and so on.  Fiction writers take some fact and embroider it with the lace needed to paint an enticing picture that tells an entertaining story.  Few set out to present history (or any other topic) factually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Fiction writers take some fact and embroider it with the lace needed to paint an enticing picture that tells an entertaining story.  Few set out to present history (or any other topic) factually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love James Michener&amp;rsquo;s work. He has generated dozens of books that provide insight into the history of various regions (Alaska, Hawaii, the Caribbean, Spain, Poland, and on and on) but I would be fool to believe that his works are 100% historically accurate.  And, again, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that Michener ever set out for accuracy.  Having read almost all of his books, including his autobiography, I suspect that he simply found the process of researching and learning about these different regions interesting and consequently used that research to provide a foundation for his stories. His histories are painted in broad brush strokes that do give the flavor of that region&amp;rsquo;s history but are likely not completely accurate.  Does the lack of absolute historical accuracy diminish his work?  Not in my view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every writer writes through a particular lens and it&amp;rsquo;s especially important, I think, to remember that history is researched, interpreted, and written through the specific lens of that writer. Dr. Price may claim to present facts to refute Brown&amp;rsquo;s storyline (I can&amp;rsquo;t say for certain that he does since I&amp;rsquo;ve not read the book) but the reader must remember that Price&amp;rsquo;s account was interpreted and written through his own lens and may, therefore, be just as historically inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m left scratching my head on why someone with a PhD would even consider Brown&amp;rsquo;s stories to be intended to be historically accurate.  They are simply works of fiction with some references to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opus Dei is an organization officially recognized by the Catholic Church.  Brown&amp;rsquo;s depiction of the organization as somehow sinister is based, from what I can understand, on controversies surrounding the organization and its cult-like activities (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_Dei&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-wife-always-wanted-to-marry-a-pilot&#34;&gt;My Wife Always Wanted to Marry a Pilot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-bit-of-background&#34;&gt;A Bit of Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became interested in drones in the spring of 2021.  My wife was preparing to retire from her teaching gig and considering a new career in real estate.  After 15 years in our relatively small town in the mountains of North Georgia, we were planning a move to a little larger town with fewer challenging hills and more conveniences. We were building a new home in our soon-to-be new town.  This was, I thought, a great time &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;to explore my interest in drones.  After all, I could document the progress of our new home and, if she did go into real estate, I would be positioned to do some of her photography.  Win!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I became interested in drones in the spring of 2021.  My wife was preparing to retire from her teaching gig and considering a new career in real estate.  After 15 years in our relatively small town in the mountains of North Georgia, we were planning a move to a little larger town with fewer challenging hills and more conveniences. We were building a new home in our soon-to-be new town.  This was, I thought, a great time &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;to explore my interest in drones.  After all, I could document the progress of our new home and, if she did go into real estate, I would be positioned to do some of her photography.  Win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, while you can fly your drone recreationally without needing a license, if you do anything that has the potential for profit, the FAA requires that you hold a license as a professional drone pilot. The fancy pants way of describing this is that you must hold an Airman certificate for small unmanned aircraft systems, more colloquially this is known as being Part 107 certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were pursuing a private pilot license to fly a manned aircraft (for example, a Piper Cub) you would have to go through some fairly rigorous ground school training, learn a ton about weather, radio lingo, how to navigate between airports (and around an airport) and so on. After completing ground school you have to spend time actually flying an aircraft under the direct tutelage of a qualified instructor before being allowed to solo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison to the manned aircraft certificate, the process for obtaining your unmanned certificate (Part 107) is a bit easier.  You only need to take certain topics from the ground school and pass a knowledge test.  No actual flight time required.  The requirements for the test are laid out for you in the &lt;em&gt;Remote Pilot &amp;ndash; Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Study Guide (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;opi=89978449&amp;amp;url=https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/remote_pilot_study_guide.pdf&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiwuJ33u-eFAxWErIQIHU7lBIUQFnoECAYQAQ&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3MXKA-tW2dc0bYz-JcA9Qh&#34;&gt;FAA-G-8082-22&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; provided by the FAA.  This study guide is fairly comprehensible, but sometimes simply reading the content isn&amp;rsquo;t enough.  I like to see and hear what I&amp;rsquo;m learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to make life a bit easier (and easier to understand) I opted to take a paid course to prepare me for the exam.  The cost of theses programs vary considerably and, so far as I know, unlike private pilot training, the FAA does not certify programs that prepare you for the exam. I chose one that seemed reasonable in cost and had good reviews: Pilot Institute. And started studying in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually went through the entire training in a few weeks and was ready to take the test. During the interim, however, my wife decided that she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pursue real estate as a second career and with that motivation gone, I decided not to continue my pursuit of the license.  After all, why pay for testing for a license that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t likely ever use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-renewed-motivation&#34;&gt;A Renewed Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a couple of years.  As I prepared for my own retirement, I began looking at my next chapter. I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed writing and thought that I might get serious about blogging regularly.  To add to that, I was fascinated by videography and realized that I could actually make videos that included drone shots.  Motivation for obtaining my license was renewed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that renewed motivation I again studied in earnest. In fact, I went through the material in about a week or 10 days. I found the information fun and interesting.  There are several areas that I want to dig into a bit more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-do-you-need-a-license&#34;&gt;Why do you need a license?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, it seems like the need for a license is just a &amp;lsquo;control&amp;rsquo; thing.  The reality is that the FAA is concerned about safety &amp;ndash; for you and the general public.  The license ensures that you are flying in a safe manner and understand what is needed to protect yourself and those around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;so-what-is-in-the-exam&#34;&gt;So, what is in the exam?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious, and most applicable, is information on the actual regulations that govern the use of sUAS (small Unmanned Aircraft Systems).  Other information I thought was pretty interesting, but much less useful.  For example, in general you&amp;rsquo;re not permitted to fly your UAS at an airport, yet the exam includes questions about the signage on runways and taxiways.  Similarly, do I really need to know how to enter a landing pattern for an airport?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be fair, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; radio controlled aircraft are considered drones or UASs.  This would include all radio controlled fixed wing model aircraft, so there is some potential applicability for this information.  But to require that knowledge on a licensing exam seems a bit over the top.  The more I studied and considered the exam, the more I began to think that perhaps the FAA felt they needed some type of licensing but didn&amp;rsquo;t really have anything to test on, so they included material that was only tangentially relevant to most drone pilots. And, to be honest, I did find the information interesting and piqued my interest to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-whats-on-the-test&#34;&gt;So, What&amp;rsquo;s on the Test?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I alluded to some of the general concepts above. More specifically, the test covers five areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airspace and Requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loading and Performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of those areas are broken down into submodules so that the overall test covers a dozen topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicable regulations relating to small unmanned aircraft system rating privileges, limitations, and flight operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airspace classification and operating requirements, and flight restrictions affecting small unmanned aircraft operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aviation weather sources and effects of weather on small unmanned aircraft performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small unmanned aircraft loading and performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emergency procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crew resource management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio communication procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determining the performance of small unmanned aircraft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physiological effects of drugs and alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aeronautical decision-making and judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airport operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintenance and pre-flight inspection procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;taking-the-exam&#34;&gt;Taking the Exam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve studied and feel prepared to take the exam, you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an account on the FAA&amp;rsquo;s Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA) website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve created your account, you&amp;rsquo;re assigned an FAA Tracking Number (FTN). This number stays with you throughout your aviation career and allows the FAA to keep all of your records together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With your FTN in hand, you then go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://faa.psiexams.com/faa/login&#34;&gt;Testing Center Website&lt;/a&gt; where you create yet another account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve created that account you simply look for testing centers that are near you. One of the challenges I ran into is that the information on testing sites is a bit confusing at first.  I found several testing sites near me that I would have preferred but couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to register.  What I discovered is that those sites, while official testing sites, either had no availability or were simply not accepting reservations.  Scrolling a bit further down the page I finally found some (relatively) nearby sites that had availability.  My closest one was about an hour away.  Chose a time and date and I was set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived about 30 minutes before my exam. One other person was there waiting to take the exam, as well.  I strongly encourage you to arrive early if for no other reason than to gather your wits about yourself before testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testing site was quite nice and the people were great.  They check you in, verify your identity and explain the process to you.  You do have to give up anything that&amp;rsquo;s in your pockets (wallet, phone, keys, etc) to ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re not cheating.  They also have cameras and a proctor watching, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel intimidated by any of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;re assigned a computer and test code, you go through a brief training program on the computer and, when you&amp;rsquo;re ready, you click start and away you go!  You&amp;rsquo;re given two hours to complete the exam. I took about an hour and that included double-checking every answer.  Most of the answers I knew right off &amp;ndash; my training was quite effective.  There were a few answers that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about and one that I had absolutely no clue. The other guy that was there started about 5 minutes or so before me and was still there when I left.  I have no clue how he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One odd thing about the testing software: Once you complete all of the questions it returns you to the first question. I assume that is to allow you to review your answers before submitting.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly clear, though, how to exit that cycle and actually submit the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve completed the exam and clicked submit you&amp;rsquo;re taken to a survey.  Once the survey is completed the software closes and you&amp;rsquo;re directed back to the proctor&amp;rsquo;s office for your score.  I made a 92!  The score report does provide feedback on the areas you missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you&amp;rsquo;re not done yet!  With your score in hand, you go back to the IACRA website to submit your application for a license. You need your Exam ID number that is assigned when you complete the test in order to apply for your license. This ties your score to you in the IACRA system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, within a few days you&amp;rsquo;ll receive an email that includes your temporary airman certificate that indicates that you&amp;rsquo;re a remote pilot of small unmanned aircraft systems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet received my permanent certificate, but it should be coming in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-you-need-to-renew-your-license&#34;&gt;Do You Need to Renew your License?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, every two years you&amp;rsquo;ll need to renew your license.  Once upon a time (before 2021) you needed to re-test in order to renew your license.  The rule has changed and now you simply need to take an online refresher course (provided by the FAA). You&amp;rsquo;ll then receive a certificate showing the completion of the course and you&amp;rsquo;re good for another 24 calendar months.  One note, though, just as you&amp;rsquo;ll need to have you Part 107 license on you when you fly, you will also need to keep a copy of the certificate of completion on you to demonstrate compliance with the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now my wife can claim to be the wife of a pilot!  (that was her idea, not mine.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How We Encourage Cheating in Education</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-we-encourage-cheating-in-education/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-we-encourage-cheating-in-education&#34;&gt;How We Encourage Cheating in Education&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was watching a news report this morning about students using ChatGPT that asked whether this was considered cheating.  That got me to thinking about how we encourage cheating in education..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it:  The purpose for education is to provide the student with the foundational knowledge they &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;need to be successful in work and life.  We all want to be successful, so cheating to get there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to me to be a very profitable endeavor.  After all, at the end of the day you still have to know how to do things in order to be successful.  I used to remind my nursing students of this all the time: If you want to be a good nurse you&amp;rsquo;re going to need to actually &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.  Cheating might get you through the class, it might even allow you to pass the licensing exam but the real test is whether you can function in the real world.  It&amp;rsquo;s a hell of a lot less stressful to actually know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing when in an emergency than to try to wing it because you lack the knowledge to actually perform correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-we-encourage-cheating-in-education&#34;&gt;How We Encourage Cheating in Education&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was watching a news report this morning about students using ChatGPT that asked whether this was considered cheating.  That got me to thinking about how we encourage cheating in education..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it:  The purpose for education is to provide the student with the foundational knowledge they &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;need to be successful in work and life.  We all want to be successful, so cheating to get there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to me to be a very profitable endeavor.

I used to remind my nursing students of this all the time: If you want to be a good nurse you&amp;rsquo;re going to need to actually &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.  Cheating might get you through the class, it might even allow you to pass the licensing exam but the real test is whether you can function in the real world.  It&amp;rsquo;s a hell of a lot less stressful to actually know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing when in an emergency than to try to wing it because you lack the knowledge to actually perform correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-we-cheat&#34;&gt;Why We Cheat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience, after twenty years of teaching, is that the reason  we cheat is that we want to get a good grade and pass the class, but we don&amp;rsquo;t want to do the actual work needed to earn that good grade.  Student&amp;rsquo;s rarely understand the purpose of education.  For them going to class, reading, studying and so on are simply obstacles to becoming an adult or, if they&amp;rsquo;re in college, obstacles to becoming a teacher, engineer, doctor, or whatever it is they want to be when they graduate.  We look for shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do we cheat to get good grades?  The simple reason is that schools (and parents) focus on grades rather than learning.  There is an assumption that grades reflect the level of learning the student has achieved and, in an ideal world, this is at least partly true&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Unfortunately, we put so much emphasis on grades that the relationship between what the student learns and what the grade reflects has been lost.  (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gocomics.com/fminus/2024/04/20?ct=v&amp;amp;cti=1968939&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; a great comic strip that sums this all up quite well!) Some students are quite adept at test-taking and can pass an exam even with little or no knowledge of the content.  Add a bit of cheating into the mix and students can complete a course while taking nothing from it.  That&amp;rsquo;s pretty damn sad in my view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, grades are often used as measures of the quality of instruction.  That is, the teacher is rated based on the number of students who pass the course.  Some years ago I had an anatomy and physiology teacher who tended to give students the test questions or answers prior to the test so that the students would be successful on the exams.  The problem, of course, is that when they got to my class where they needed to apply the knowledge they were expected to have brought from that class they struggled.  Rather than realize that the A&amp;amp;P teacher failed them, the students blamed me for demanding that they know the information.  Sorry &amp;ndash; if you&amp;rsquo;re going to take care of cardiac patients, you need to know how the heart works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, because students didn&amp;rsquo;t do well in my class I was reviewed as an ineffective instructor rather than the victim of an incompetent prior instructor.  It never seemed to occur to my higher-ups that my class depended on knowledge provided by a prerequisite course.  If that course failed the student, that negatively affected me.  (We won&amp;rsquo;t get into how that whole process reeks of a lack of critical thinking on the part of the manager.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-how-do-we-fix-this&#34;&gt;So, How Do We Fix This?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, we would, first, do away with grading.  Rather, we would work to determine whether or not the student understands the concepts that are being taught, identify the areas where they are still struggling then work to ensure that those areas are properly addressed so that the student does, in fact, master the concepts.  Grading really accomplishes nothing except to demoralize the student who is struggling. It reinforces the notion that the student cannot achieve success.  It also establishes a &amp;ldquo;pecking order&amp;rdquo; both for the teacher and for students.  With grades, the goals becomes the grade rather than mastery of the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the reality is that this approach is not practical when working with large numbers of students.  It also would not be accepted by legislators because they would no longer have something to complain about. After all, if all students actually achieved their goals, that would show that the educational system is working, which is anathema to politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue is how to go about determining if the student understands the concepts.  In fact, there are multiple ways to accomplish this though designing and implementing those approaches may prove daunting in a larger classroom.  Some schools use peer grading where students evaluate each other&amp;rsquo;s work for quality, etc.  Evaluating the same content using multiple approaches helps to tease out those areas where the student has on-going weaknesses so that they can be addressed.  Oral exams, rather than written tests, may allow the student to more fully express their understanding of the content.  Allowing the student to describe or apply &amp;rsquo;every thing they know about&amp;rsquo; a topic may help identify what is important to the student and what their actual level of understanding is.  Remember that when teachers write a test they are identifying what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; believe is important, not what the student feels is most important.  This approach, in particular, allows the student to apply their understanding to their specific situation and may actually provide the teacher new insights into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other approaches, such as standards based testing, equity grading, and so on that have the potential to improve education and achieve the true goal of education &amp;ndash; learning.  Unfortunately, too many people cling to the old ways because &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s the way it&amp;rsquo;s always been done.&amp;rdquo;  Then complain because it isn&amp;rsquo;t working. And until &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; problem is resolved nothing will change and cheating will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No test or paper can truly reflect what a student knows and understands about a topic.  Testing and papers and other means of &amp;lsquo;grading&amp;rsquo; give approximations of that knowledge.  Tests are often written to reflect what the teacher believes to be most important.  The student, meanwhile, may have learned something entirely different but which is more important to them than what the teacher believes to be important.  Education is ultimately, I believe, about what meets the student&amp;rsquo;s needs rather than what an arbitrary external resources believes is important.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-i-think-crypto-is-stupid&#34;&gt;Why I Think Crypto is Stupid&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/faruk-ozer-turkey-crypto-fraud/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about Faruk  Ozer, The CEO of Turkey&amp;rsquo;s biggest Cryptocurrency business.  That article outlines how tens of thousands of Turkish people were victims of Ozer&amp;rsquo;s theft of their crypto wallets and all of their assets.  The thing that stood out to me is how easy it was for him to simply download their accounts onto a thumb drive and be off with their money.   In the wake of the crypto crimes of Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX) and Changpeng&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Zhao (Binance) I fail to understand why anyone would trust their financial assets and future to something so easily stolen.  Unlike banks, there is no FDIC insurance. Unlike stocks and bonds there is no physical document to show ownership. (Yes, I realize that most transactions exist in the &amp;rsquo;ether&amp;rsquo; but using a reputable trading house provides a level of safety that they are unlikely to steal your money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-i-think-crypto-is-stupid&#34;&gt;Why I Think Crypto is Stupid&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/faruk-ozer-turkey-crypto-fraud/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about Faruk  Ozer, The CEO of Turkey&amp;rsquo;s biggest Cryptocurrency business.  That article outlines how tens of thousands of Turkish people were victims of Ozer&amp;rsquo;s theft of their crypto wallets and all of their assets.  The thing that stood out to me is how easy it was for him to simply download their accounts onto a thumb drive and be off with their money.   In the wake of the crypto crimes of Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX) and Changpeng&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Zhao (Binance) I fail to understand why anyone would trust their financial assets and future to something so easily stolen.  Unlike banks, there is no FDIC insurance. Unlike stocks and bonds there is no physical document to show ownership. (Yes, I realize that most transactions exist in the &amp;rsquo;ether&amp;rsquo; but using a reputable trading house provides a level of safety that they are unlikely to steal your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many of us may not fully understand stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and the like, they have been around a very long time and there are plenty of resources available to help you wrap your head around those concepts.  Do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; understand cryptocurrency?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my rules in personal finance is to never invest in anything that you do not understand.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand cryptocurrency and how it works, don&amp;rsquo;t invest in it. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks and bonds are rooted, ultimately, in a physical business with physical and financial assets.  That is, there is intrinsic value in the stock or bond. There are regulations through the Securities and Exchange Commission that govern how these stocks and bonds are traded.  On what is cryptocurrency based? From what I can tell, it rooted in the belief that it has value.  And it&amp;rsquo;s nothing more than belief.  There is no physical &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; that underlies the value of crypto. And there are no protections or, so far as I am aware, any regulations around them. It is the wild west of of stupidity, in my view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a lot of folks that will point out that the US dollar is similarly unmoored from anything physical. And that is absolutely true. However, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; backed by the government and is the official currency of the government. And, while the government has its problems, the US dollar is accepted as valid currency here and in many areas abroad. Cryptocurrency lacks any such backing.  In effect, so far as I understand it, cryptocurrency has value only because we believe it has value.  So, too, did Beanie Babies, pet rocks, Cabbage Patch Kids, and a host of other &amp;ldquo;collectibles&amp;rdquo; until we no longer believed they had value, then their &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo; evaporated.   There is one major difference between these &amp;ldquo;collectibles&amp;rdquo; and cryptocurrency: Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t believe the items have any real value, they are still physical assets and at some point in the future they may again have value. (Think about old toys that are now considered antiques which has enhanced their value.) Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is not a physical &amp;rsquo;thing&amp;rsquo; consequently there will be no future for it. Once it disappears it is simply gone, like a puddle of water in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another rule of personal finance management is to never risk more than you can afford to lose.  Many people (too many!) put large sums of money into crypto when they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.  Many people believe that crypto can make them a great deal of money quickly.  But, as the old saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  It is likely that cryptocurrency is making a lot of money for some people, but they&amp;rsquo;re likely doing it at the expense of others.  You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be that &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-thoughts-on-competency-based-education&#34;&gt;My Thoughts on Competency Based Education&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competency based education has gathered quite a lot of steam over the last few years.  Many universities now assert that they are competency based and promote this as somehow better than traditional education.  In general, it seems that competency based education is a way of expediting the educational process whereby the student can move forward more quickly so long as the student can demonstrate competence in a subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-thoughts-on-competency-based-education&#34;&gt;My Thoughts on Competency Based Education&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competency based education has gathered quite a lot of steam over the last few years.  Many universities now assert that they are competency based and promote this as somehow better than traditional education.  In general, it seems that competency based education is a way of expediting the educational process whereby the student can move forward more quickly so long as the student can demonstrate competence in a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, education was concerned with &amp;lsquo;seat time&amp;rsquo;. A correlation was assumed (though I don&amp;rsquo;t think ever validated) &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; between the amount of time the student spent studying and sitting in classes and their success in learning.  Success, of course, was determined by taking multiple-guess tests, writing papers, etc.  What this approach did not take into account, particularly for older students, is what the student brings to the table.  The classic example of this is the IT student who, through years of personal study and hobby practice, has become proficient in coding programs.  Requiring this student to sit through basic programming courses which teach skills the student mastered long ago is clearly unnecessary. The &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo;, however, did not take these students into account and there was rarely a means for the student to test out of the course by demonstrating that they had already mastered the material. (From my own experience, while completing my MBA I was required to take an introductory statistics course despite having already passed advanced statistics and quantitative methods!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competency based education is designed to allow the student to &amp;rsquo;test out&amp;rsquo; of a course by demonstrating that they already possess the skills and knowledge the course was designed to teach. The ideal situation is that the student who lacks the skills or knowledge taught in a particular course is able to go through the course and develop those skills or obtain that knowledge. Meanwhile, the student who already possesses the skills and knowledge is able to move on to the next course which may teach content with which they are unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sounds-great-so-whats-the-issue&#34;&gt;Sounds great! So, What&amp;rsquo;s the Issue?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several concerns I have with competency based education and, specifically, how it is promoted and administered by many schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what do we mean by &amp;ldquo;competent&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago I undertook an intensive program that crammed two years of IT into six months. By and large there were few tests.  Our progress was determined by our ability to accomplish the tasks we were assigned to complete. For example, in a one month course we learned to program in C and Perl.  The instructor determined whether we passed based on whether: a) the program ran; and, b) the program did what it was expected to do. Whether the code was written cleanly or was efficient didn&amp;rsquo;t matter; if it ran and did what it was intended to do, we were considered competent in programming in that language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a pilot is considered competent if she can consistently get the plane aloft, fly to the intended destination, and land the plane in one piece.  A doctor may be considered competent if he can consistently arrive at a valid diagnosis, prescribe relevant treatment, and obtain a positive patient outcome. A surgeon might be considered competent if she can consistently perform the procedure without causing undue harm to the patient and, again, obtain an overall positive outcome.  Whether any of these professionals follow appropriate practices, achieve their outcomes efficiently and effectively, or not is not really a consideration. They are competent if they achieved the intended outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the classroom, if you ask the faculty of most schools to define &amp;ldquo;competence&amp;rdquo; they will most likely struggle to do so or provide various different definitions. Students bring their own definitions and understanding to the table, often situating their definition in a way that lightens their burden of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therein lies the first concern:  What do we mean by competent and how do we determine it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the first issue is simply clearly defining what one means by &amp;ldquo;competent&amp;rdquo; and ensuring that everyone &amp;ndash; all faculty and students &amp;ndash; share that one clear meaning.  It may be different for different schools, but everyone within the same institution should have the same understanding of its meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dictionary.com&lt;/em&gt; defines competence as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having suitable or sufficient skill, knowledge, experience, etc., for some purpose; properly qualified: He is perfectly competent to manage the bank branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adequate but not exceptional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we determine whether a student has sufficient skill, knowledge, experience, etc?  Would you consider a surgeon who has demonstrated one successful heart surgery competent?  Would you allow them to operate on you (without a more highly experienced doctor in attendance)?  I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t.  I would want to know that the the surgeon has successfully performed multiple heart surgeries before I&amp;rsquo;d allow them to operate on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skills and knowledge are not interchangeable. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve worked alongside people who had great &amp;ldquo;book knowledge&amp;rdquo; but couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out which end of the screwdriver to hold. Being able to pass a multiple choice test (which basically means they can identify the correct answer when they see it) demonstrates neither sufficient skill nor knowledge of the subject.  At the very least, the student should be required to pass multiple tests, preferably of different forms (written, oral, etc). Yet some schools rely on a single exam to determine that a student is competent in a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the examples provided earlier really describe what I would consider to be a minimal level of competence. Yes, each of those examples may have achieved an intended outcome, but they may also have skipped important steps, kludged fixes for errors that popped up, and so on.  They may not follow best practices and, as a result, may actually produce an inferior product. Yes, it works but does it work well and efficiently?  Well-written computer programs, for example, have very few, if any, unnecessary lines of code, contains clear documentation of what each line of code or block of code is intended to accomplish, and compile into efficient programs.  In the examples above, the best you might hope for is &amp;ldquo;adequate&amp;rdquo;.  Again, do you want someone who does an adequate job, or one that does an exceptional job.  If I&amp;rsquo;m a hiring agency, I&amp;rsquo;ll generally choose the second option because it will end up costing me less in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue is ensuring that students are actually demonstrating competence through multiple assessments using different modalities.  It&amp;rsquo;s simply too easy for a student to &amp;lsquo;get lucky&amp;rsquo; in passing a single exam. And, particularly with online schools the test questions and answers, other students&amp;rsquo; papers, and so on are available online so students may actually pass a course but take away absolutely no knowledge of the course content. (That&amp;rsquo;s actually a travesty because the student is not getting what they&amp;rsquo;re paying for, but it is their decisions to short-change them.). Multiple assessments, using multiple modalities &amp;ndash; including hands-on demonstrations &amp;ndash; helps to ensure that the student actually is competent in the content and didn&amp;rsquo;t just get lucky on their assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third issue, in my view, is that while some students truly are competent in the content and are able to demonstrate their competence satisfactorily, many are not.  However, because of the marketing schools do for their programs, many students believe that competency based education and the potential for accelerating their progress means that they don&amp;rsquo;t need to take the time actually learn the content. They just want to take the test and move on.  They fail to understand that it is important to focus on the areas where they are not competent so that they become competent in those areas and, therefore, are fully prepared for the professional role they are pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-is-competency-based-education-a-bad-idea&#34;&gt;So is Competency-Based Education a Bad Idea?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear: I believe in competency based learning because I believe, when properly administered, competency-based learning ensures that the student possesses all of the skills and knowledge needed to be successful in their chosen field. In fact, properly administered, I believe competency based education may be superior to our traditional educational model because the student has the opportunity to identify areas of weakness, work to strengthen those areas, then prove their competence.  In other words, competency based education, again properly administered, can be expected to provide more graduates who each possess a greater set of skills and knowledge than a traditional classroom because the student must demonstrate competence before continuing on, unlike tradtional schools where, even if the student fails a test, they continue on to the next topic or class. (I have a post planned that explores the grading system.) I believe it also allows the student who brings appropriate knowledge, skills, and experience to the table to bypass courses which are redundant for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that goal, though, requires that schools be clear in their definitions, consistent in their application of those definitions, and rigorous in their determination of competence to ensure that the students are truly prepared for their professional roles. Competency-based assessment is hard.  It requires the development of specific, demanding assessments of varied types (oral, written, hands-on, etc) in order to ensure that the student is truly competent. It also requires that schools routinely, and frequently, update their assessments to prevent students from accessing other students&amp;rsquo; work and suggestions which might allow the student to pass the course without actually engaging the course materials and without any real knowledge of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I think too few schools are willing to invest that much effort into the process and, as a result, turn out students who are only marginally competent (if at all).  These student may, at best, meet that second definition of competence: adequate, but not exceptional.  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why anyone who wants to be successful in their career would settle for being adequate when they have the potential be be exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Don&#39;t Trust Gmail. Here&#39;s Why</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why&#34;&gt;I Don&amp;rsquo;t Trust Gmail. Here&amp;rsquo;s Why.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had an email address with Gmail for probably 20 years.  I mean my email address is my name @ Gmail. No numbers, no weird abbreviations, no strange punctuations, just my firstnamelastname @gmail.com How long has it been since that was possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three or four years ago I began receiving emails to my address that were clearly intended for another pers&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;on with my same name.  Their email was literally my email address!  At first I thought it was just an glitch in the system. Later I thought perhaps they had simply mis-typed their name (maybe left out a letter or something) or had made up a name so that they did not get spam emails.  However, many of those emails were for legitimate purposes &amp;ndash; receipts from Tractor Supply or from their cell phone provider.  What gives?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why&#34;&gt;I Don&amp;rsquo;t Trust Gmail. Here&amp;rsquo;s Why.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had an email address with Gmail for probably 20 years.  I mean my email address is my name @ Gmail. No numbers, no weird abbreviations, no strange punctuations, just my firstnamelastname @gmail.com How long has it been since that was possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three or four years ago I began receiving emails to my address that were clearly intended for another pers&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;on with my same name.  Their email was literally my email address!  At first I thought it was just an glitch in the system. Later I thought perhaps they had simply mis-typed their name (maybe left out a letter or something) or had made up a name so that they did not get spam emails.  However, many of those emails were for legitimate purposes &amp;ndash; receipts from Tractor Supply or from their cell phone provider.  What gives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that there are at least a dozen folks out there here in the US and in South Africa and Australia that share my name.  But Gmail should not allow anyone else to create an account with the same user name.  Yet, clearly, when I look at the emails intended for those other Kevins it is very clear that they are using the same email address.  How is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me, then, that if I am receiving their emails, they are likely seeing some of mine.  Not a good plan!  I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to figure out how to contact Gmail to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on and how this could be happening but so far I haven&amp;rsquo;t been successful.  And, frankly, with so many other email accounts available to me (outlook, yahoo, icloud, etc) I don&amp;rsquo;t really need the Gmail account anymore.  I keep it simply because I&amp;rsquo;ve had it so long and there are still a (very) few folks that only have that address for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t use Gmail for anything embarrassing or nefarious but, still, the idea that others may be receiving emails intended for me is, to say the least unsettling. So, since I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to track down why I am receiving emails intended for others and how it is possible for others to create accounts using my same username (there are at least two!) I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that I can trust Gmail. For that reason I no longer use it for anything other than as an address to use when I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to receive emails to my primary service (I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that in another post).  That&amp;rsquo;s sad, because Gmail used to be a good service.  But, I guess when you get too big for your britches you lose control of a lot of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-technology&#34;&gt;My Technology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common discussion in any of the technology forums is which platform is better.  Some argue that Windows is best, others that Mac is and others, still, argue that Linux beats them all.  What is my take? Well&amp;hellip; it depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###I am Operating System Agnostic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly, I am.  I have all three operating systems in use in my home as I write this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my technology back in 1984 or 1985 with a Commodore 128.  It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long at all to capture &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;my imagination and soon I was doing some Basic programming, playing games, writing papers, etc all on that little computer.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure my wife was all that impressed.  But, boy, I sure was!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure my wife was all that impressed.  But, boy, I sure was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered the C/PM software that would run on the Commodore, but never quite figured that out.  I was just beginning to learn about the workings of the device, so that OS was beyond me.  I&amp;rsquo;d love to get my hands on a working copy now, just to see if I could understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that humble beginning a nearly forty year love affair with computers was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;####Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Windows since the 3.1 days and have had every iteration of that OS since.  I think my first real Windows PC was  a Packard-Bell 286.  I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the specs (it&amp;rsquo;s been over 30 years) but you can imagine that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t terribly impressive compared to today&amp;rsquo;s computers, but it was close to state-of-the-art in 1987 or 1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, I&amp;rsquo;m quite comfortable with Windows. I know it. I can use it without thinking (almost). And the range and depth of software that is available for Windows is hard to beat. Sometimes the only option is a Windows-based solution.  In those cases, the mini-pc that runs Windows gets fired up and off we go to get my work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the various desktop versions, I also ran Windows Home Server until it was deprecated in 2011, then switched over to Windows Server 2012.  While WHS seemed to work well and I had few problems with it (I was sad to see Microsoft drop it), I never really got comfortable using the full-blown Server version.  Just seemed more complicated than it needed to be.  I jumped over to Linux for my server needs and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three Windows computers in my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My wife uses one for her personal work (though not terribly often as she prefers her iPad).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My work computer is provided by my employer and I spent at least 40 hours a week tapping away at the technology that resides on that device.  I regularly use Microsoft products &amp;ndash; Word, Teams, Outlook, Excel, and so on in order to get my work done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also have a personal Windows computer, An Asus VC-66 mini-PC running Windows 10 pro.  That one isn&amp;rsquo;t seeing as much use as it once did for reasons that I&amp;rsquo;ll outline below.  Mostly now I keep it around for some of the programs that I can&amp;rsquo;t get on one of the other devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;####Mac OS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought my first Mac in 2005 &amp;ndash; a mac mini.  I loved that little device even though it was a bit more expensive than I would have liked and required all the peripherals be purchased separately. Sadly, it was based on the now-defunct PowerPC G4 which would be deprecated the following year when Apple moved to the Intel processor.  Still, I used the mac mini until around 2012 when I could no longer get updates for the PowerPC processor.  Shortly thereafter,  (sometime in 2012 or 2013) it began to fail and was put out of my misery a few months later.  I was quite sad to see it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I did not replace the MM with another, that experience did begin my quest for smaller, more compact and less power hungry PCs which is pretty much where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next Mac acquistion was a 2009 iMac.  Huge monitor, huge hard drive and lots of power.  I ran every version of Mac OS on that one up until it, too, died this past year.  Getting more than 10 years out of a computer that is on 24/7 and in pretty much constant use is actually pretty amazing. I still have the body, it just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t boot.  I&amp;rsquo;ve read somewhere that you can use an old iMac as a secondary screen.  I may look into that at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also owned two Macbook Airs.  The first was a 2011 model, purchased, as I recall sometime in mid-2012. At the time I was traveling regularly for my doctorate and needed something light and powerful and easy to type on.  when you&amp;rsquo;re writing a lot (and I mean A LOT) you want a comfortable keyboard.  The Air fit the bill.  This was replaced in 2020 with a more powerful Air.  That laptop now lives primarily in my living room where it is used for surfing the &amp;rsquo;net and getting some work done when I want to work outside the office. (I love working on my patio when the weather is nice.  Beats the heck out of a stale office!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;####IOS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss to not mention that we have two iPads in the house.  My wife&amp;rsquo;s favorite device is her iPad.  She&amp;rsquo;s on it almost more than I&amp;rsquo;m on any of my machines.  I used mine much less often, mostly for quickly skimming the news or reading books (when not using my Kobo or Kindle).  And, of course, we&amp;rsquo;ve also two iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t say much else, since there&amp;rsquo;s not much else to say about these!  They are what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;####Linux:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, here it get&amp;rsquo;s a bit interesting, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around 1997 I obtained my first &amp;rsquo;live&amp;rsquo; linux distro in one of the PC magazines (I forget which one). At that point my only experience was with the Commodore 128 and Windows. Needless to say, my curiosity was piqued (as it had been with C/PM a decade earlier) and I quickly loaded up the disk and was met with a black screen and a blinking cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No instructions, no guidance on how to use this OS or what could be done with it.  I mucked around for maybe half an hour, shutdown and threw the disk away, pretty much as I had done with C/PM (though I had not thrown those disks out, I just set them aside forever).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward about three years and I found myself in an intensive technology program where I was introduced to programming (primarily C and Perl), web development, database development, and networking.  I was in love.  We were using Sun Sparc computers with the Solaris operating system.  I quickly learned a great deal about Unix and figured out what could be done with that blinking cursor in the black abyss of the computer screen. For some reason, that black screen invoked an image of the infiniteness of space in me. (too much Star Wars, I guess.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, from there I moved into the Linux world and over the next several years bought several used computers on which to install Linux. I think I tried just about every distro there was.  That love affair has continued for more than 23 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge with Linux has always been installing software and &amp;lsquo;dependency hell&amp;rsquo;.  With the advent of Snaps, Flatpak, and AppImages (not to mention Docker), this issue has pretty well disappeared.  I routinely install software packages without a hiccup and they just work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I have five computers running Linux in various flavors and forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &amp;lsquo;daily driver&amp;rsquo; is Fedora 38 running on a used Dell Wyse 5070 Thin Client. Those make great little low-power Linux boxes.  They&amp;rsquo;re powerful enough, even, to run virtual machines!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have Proxmox running on a renewed HP EliteDesk 800 G3 with 64 GB ram, an i7 quad core processor and about  1.5 TB of storage.  On that device I have an additional four Linux VMs (Ubuntu, Debian, and Windows 10) and multiple LXCs that host various services I use.  The Ubuntu instance serves as the foundation for about two dozen Docker containers that provide a range of services I regularly use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have an HP Microserver Gen 10 Plus with 3 TB storage and 64 GB ram. This one is running Unraid (I wanted to try it and figured out I rather like it). This one serves as a NAS and also hosts several more Docker images for services I use, but less often than those on the EliteDesk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there&amp;rsquo;s are two more computers that are used primarily for learning (currently Ansible) and testing. First is a 2011 Lenovo Yoga 2 and a rebuilt 1L PC that I originally bought in 2009 as a weather server (I ran a personal weather station for 10 years). The original motherboard was 32 bits, so I upgraded that one about three years ago to an ASRock MB with a Celeron processor.  I wanted low-power for learning and this one fits the bill. Both the Lenovo and this no-name are running Ubuntu or whatever flavor of Linux I&amp;rsquo;m testing at the time. While VMs can be used to test software, I like to do bare metal installs to get a better feel for responsiveness than the VM experience can sometimes provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wrapping-it-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping It Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where does that leave me with respect to my operating system preferences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said at the beginning, I routinely use all three OSes.  Excluding my work PC (over which I have no control) I tend toward the Linux machines. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the idea of using something a little less mainstream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both Mac OS and Windows gather a lot of analytics about their use.  On the one hand I don&amp;rsquo;t mind that since most of it is used to help enhance and improve the product.  On the other hand, there&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of paranoia about them knowing &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; about what I do, what products I use, what I type, etc. Linux doesn&amp;rsquo;t collect analytics for the most part.  As I understand it, you can still opt out of any data collection.  I like that idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is free and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require periodic (and sometimes costly) updates to maintain function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the challenge that Linux can provide in figuring out how to do things.  This has actually gotten easier, though,  as I mentioned above, with the advent of Snaps, Flatpak, etc. Still, it can be a challenge at times. I spend. a lot more time on the command line than I would have expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just the result of a bit more familiarlity, but doing things like working with webservers and databases seems easier in Linux.  Trying to figure out IIS on Windows is a pain! Build an Access database?  Thank you, no.  I find it easer to create a MariaDB and associated front end than to sort out how Access handles things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The quality of the software available today rivals that of Mac and Windows. Not in all respects, to be sure, but for 99% of what I do it is more than adequate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it meets my needs.  I can make it as simple or complex as I want it to be and that suits me just fine!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;returning-to-basics&#34;&gt;Returning to Basics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of this blog is iamcuri.us.  That title was chosen to reflect the many and sundry interests that I have and the drive I have to explore new ideas and to learn new things.  While I think some of my posts here have reflected that, others seems to skew in specific directions that seem to narrow the focus on the blog.  Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.  Maybe the posts that outline my tinkering in websites and self-hosting do reflect my questioning and exploring and learning. Still, I think that it&amp;rsquo;s time I pushed into some new areas a&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;nd revisit in more detail some old areas, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;philosopy&#34;&gt;Philosopy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first real introduction to philosophy was through my doctoral program.  In fact, the introduction to the topic was a bit abrupt and jarring.  The very first class in my doctoral program was in the philosophy of science course. To say it was bewildering was an understatement.  The lectures were interesting, though I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I understood a great deal of them.  The readings, likewise, were challenging. Still, I persisted and managed to do fairly well in the course, even while feeling I had no idea what it was all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a couple of years and I became interested in the concepts of critical thinking.  Now, thinking is a core aspect of philosophy so if I was to gain any understanding of critical thinking I realized I would need to get a better handle on philosophy.  In fits and starts I&amp;rsquo;ve been adding to my understanding by reading, somewhat haphazardly, the writings of various philosophers, notably the ancient ones such as Plato, Aristotle, and the like but also some more recent ones such as Kuhn, Popper, and Watts.  But my approach was disjointed and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was building the proper foundation.  What I needed was a structured approach to learning more about philosophy.  But, where to start? What are the best first readings?  How do I layer my learning so that I build on prior learning without jumping into the deep end of the pool and feeling totally lost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;physics&#34;&gt;Physics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve expanded my reading on a variety of topics over the last several years, one topic that keeps coming up in various ways is that of physics.  I know nothing of physics, though I do find the articles I&amp;rsquo;ve read on topics related to physics interesting and I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself wanting to know more.  As with philosophy, though, the question was where to begin.  Physics is a huge and confusing field.  Would a &amp;ldquo;dummies&amp;rdquo; book benefit me?  I didn&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, while reading &lt;em&gt;The Structure of Science&lt;/em&gt; by Thomas Kuhn.  Kuhn was a physicist by training who stumbled into the history of science and later into the philosphy of science. That transition actually made sense to me.  But, in reading that essay I was struck by the broad range of topics in which Kuhn seemed to be conversant. Ponder this, of course, I realized that his background in the history of science required him to understand the basics of the broad range of concepts that constitute &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo;. I also realized that his background in physics seemed to provide him a particularly sound starting point for mastering these other topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve set my cap to learning a bit more about physics (In fact, I did this about four years ago but never acted on it.)  How to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-path-forward&#34;&gt;A Path Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While searching for some hints on how to begin teaching myself physics, quite by accident I ran across an article by Susan Fleming entitled, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/26/from-the-fledgling-physicist-archives-if-susan-can-learn-physics-so-can-you%22&#34;&gt;If Susan Can Learn Physics, So Can You&lt;/a&gt;.  This blog post laid out, step-by-step, a course of study that reflected a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in physics.  Now, I really don&amp;rsquo;t care to get &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; deep into it (or maybe I do), but at least she gave me a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as they say on TV, &amp;ldquo;But Wait!  There&amp;rsquo;s More!&amp;rdquo;  Ms. Fleming is now Mrs. Rigetti and she has changed her website, but provided follow up post for a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in philosopy entitled, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.susanrigetti.com/philosophy&#34;&gt;So You Want to Learn Philosopy &amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;.  She was the answer to my dreams!  How did it come to be that she was able to do this?  I briefly read her bio and it seems she was a philosphy major who, with no prior experience in physics and little mathematical background, was cajoled by college advisor to take physics as an elective.  I&amp;rsquo;ll let you follow the two links to her sites to get the lowdown on her path to two majors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-road-map&#34;&gt;The Road Map&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now I have two paths to follow.  How to proceed.  My plan, perhaps foolish as it might be, is to begin with philosophy. I intend to follow, as closely as possible the curriculum she has laid out for that domain.  I figure two years to get through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, because I&amp;rsquo;m really a glutton for punishment, I&amp;rsquo;ll tackle the physics curriculum.  That&amp;rsquo;s at least another two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest about something: I have no intentions of ever using the knowledge gained for anything other than self edification.  I do not aspire to by a &amp;lsquo;Philosopher&amp;rsquo; (though I suspect most everyone becomes one at some point in time) and I certainly do not expect to make a career or even get a job in physics.  But, having the knowledge, being able to understand just a little better some of the topics that seem so esoteric to me, at the moment seems worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My 2020 Reading List</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/my-2020-reading-list/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-2020-reading-list&#34;&gt;My 2020 Reading List&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set as a goal in 2020 the ambitious aim to complete 50 books over 52 weeks.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get there, but I did manage to complete 26.  In addition, I read parts of four others and read probably a 100 or more journal and long-form magazine articles from a variety of sources.  The four that I did not complete simply failed to sustain my interest. In general, I try to muddle through a book out of respect to the author&amp;rsquo;s efforts.  But, I have come to realize &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; that sometimes the best use of my time is not to spend time on an endeavor that I found not interesting or relevant to my interests.  A couple of others, chiefly on electronics, I&amp;rsquo;m still working on, as they are detailed, and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;tips-for-working-from-home&#34;&gt;Tips for Working from Home&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the coronavirus, many employers have shifted as many workers as possible to teleworking. That is, working from home.  This can be a real challenge if you&amp;rsquo;ve not had experience with working from home.  I&amp;rsquo;ve worked from home for the last seven years, so  I think I have some pretty reasonable suggestions to help you be successful while working from home and to help you ensure you have an appopriate balance between &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;work and not-work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;tips-for-working-from-home&#34;&gt;Tips for Working from Home&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the coronavirus, many employers have shifted as many workers as possible to teleworking. That is, working from home.  This can be a real challenge if you&amp;rsquo;ve not had experience with working from home.  I&amp;rsquo;ve worked from home for the last seven years, so  I think I have some pretty reasonable suggestions to help you be successful while working from home and to help you ensure you have an appopriate balance between &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;work and not-work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from home presents a number of challenges. As I take you through my suggestions, I&amp;rsquo;ll address many of those challenges. I think it&amp;rsquo;s important, too, to remember that this is a change and, like all changes, is initially difficult but becomes easier over time.  Don&amp;rsquo;t get stressed if you have difficulty focusing at first.  With practice it becomes easier to mentally separate &amp;lsquo;work&amp;rsquo; from &amp;rsquo;not-work&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dedicate-space&#34;&gt;Dedicate space&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If at all possible, set up an office space that is separate from your living space.  A spare bedroom is ideal. This space should be used &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for work. If you want to surf the internet, go to a different space. and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; do your work from in this space (I&amp;rsquo;ll touch on this again later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary reason for this recommendation is so that when you&amp;rsquo;re in that space your mind says, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m at work.&amp;rdquo;  When I worked in a brick-and-mortar school I found it easy to focus on my work.  I was in my office, surrounded by the tools I needed to do the lesson planning, research, and so on that were parts of my job. There were fewer distractions and, because I mentally associated the space with &amp;lsquo;work&amp;rsquo;, I was less likely to spend time surfing the internet and so on. That environment helped me to stay focused on the work I was doing and avoid unnecessary distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You obviously cannot fully duplicate that environment at home. You can, however, create a similar space so that when you are in that space you minimize distractions.  Over time your mind will increasingly associate that space with &amp;lsquo;work&amp;rsquo; so that distractions tend to fall to the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;keep-regular-hours&#34;&gt;Keep regular hours&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people the idea of working from home suggests a great deal of flexibility in when you work. Depending on your organization&amp;rsquo;s requirements, that may be true.  However, I have found that setting and keeping regular office hours helps me to be productive.  The problem with that increased flexibility is that you end up putting work off, prioritizing those other activities.  Not a good plan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, we prefer a significant degree of predictability in our lives.  Keeping regular office hours helps to provide the predictability. It also ensures that you get the work done that your boss expects you to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you become more accustomed to working from home, you may find that you can successfully flex your hours a bit and still be productive.  I certainly have.  But, until you&amp;rsquo;ve really got a good handle on managing your time when working from home, I strongly encourage you to set and follow a regular work schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;keep-your-personal-habits-and-routines-intact&#34;&gt;Keep your personal habits and routines intact&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another vision that many people have of working from home is being able to &amp;lsquo;work in my PJs&amp;rsquo;.  And, I sometimes (often) do.  But, again, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this quite a while and have developed good work habits, as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new at-home worker, I strongly encourage you to continue your usual &amp;lsquo;going to work&amp;rsquo; routines.  Shave, dress in your &amp;lsquo;work&amp;rsquo; clothes (including shoes!), and do all the other things you usually do in preparation for going to work.  Why?  Again, there is a mental connection between these activities and working.  These routines help you to get into the right mental frame to get to work when you sit down at your desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying in your PJs, on the other hand, suggests a more leisurely approach to your work.  As a result, you may find that you&amp;rsquo;re not very productive and easily distracted.  Set your self up for success by preparing yourself mentally for &amp;lsquo;going to work&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;take-frequent-breaks&#34;&gt;Take frequent breaks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the office environment, we seldom work straight through our day.  We take coffee breaks, we talk with colleagues, we get up and wander around the office, and so on.  Working from home you&amp;rsquo;re often alone and so you&amp;rsquo;ll tend to keep working.  This isn&amp;rsquo;t good for you or your productivity either physically or mentally. Get up at least every hour and walk around.  Read something that is unrelated to your work.  Go for a walk around the block for sunshine and fresh air.  These things help you to maintain physical health and mental focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, you might say, won&amp;rsquo;t I be less productive?  Maybe.  My guess is that you won&amp;rsquo;t.  There are two reasons for this. First, with fewer office distractions, when you&amp;rsquo;re focused on your work, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to get more done than in the usual office environment.  Second, physical activity improves mental function so that frequent breaks allows your mind to &amp;lsquo;reset&amp;rsquo; itself, allowing you to be more mentally alert.  These two factors helps to improve your overall performance.  While the research is somewhat inconclusive, there is some evidence that working from home, for many people, is more productive than working in an office environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;keep-work-and-home-separate&#34;&gt;Keep work and home separate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I teach online. This means that my students are constantly emailing, requesting guidance in the course.  One of the biggest challenges for me is avoiding getting drawn back into work when I&amp;rsquo;m out of the office.  I don&amp;rsquo;t check my email when I&amp;rsquo;m scheduled out of the office.  It is important that I keep my personal time separate from my work time.  I got caught in that trap for a while wherein I would intend to take 2 minutes to check my email, only to find myself 2 hours later still responding to emails, providing feedback, and so on.  With the office just a few steps away, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to do. Don&amp;rsquo;t do it!  This is actually one of the reasons why I recommend a dedicated office space. You can close the door, symbolically saying, &amp;ldquo;the office is closed for the day&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dealing-with-distractions&#34;&gt;Dealing with distractions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first began working from home I was fortunate that my wife worked outside the home.  That meant that, for the most part, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with interruptions during the work day. Given the circumstances with the coronavirus, that may not be the case for you.  So, one of the potential challenges is a spouse, child, or other who believes that because you&amp;rsquo;re home, you&amp;rsquo;re available to them.  You&amp;rsquo;re not &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;re at work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do you deal with them?  The best way is to simply be upfront: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m at work right now.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a break in 20 minutes; I&amp;rsquo;ll talk with you then.&amp;rdquo; Setting boundaries is essential to ensuring a successful work-at-home experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;managing-work-and-homeschool&#34;&gt;Managing work and homeschool&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in truth, setting strict &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in the office&amp;rdquo; rules may not always be possible.  You may have kids at home that need on-going guidance in order to get their schoolwork done.  That&amp;rsquo;s okay.  Schedule specific times during the day that are set aside to help them.  You may end up having to extend your workday a bit, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay.  Both you and the kids are being productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schedules for both you and the kids are important.  Setting aside five or 10 minutes each hour to get them started on a new study program will help set them up for success in their studies, will help give you a break from your own work, and will allow for a smooth (hopefully) work-at-home life for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t set tight schedules. Tight schedules is a sure way to create frustation.  Allow ample time for activities. Just because you work 9 to 5 normally, or the kids go to school from 8 to 3 doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you have to adhere to those schedules when working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create schedules that allow ample time to complete activities followed by some free time each hour or two.  Those frequent breaks make the work more tolerable and, often, more productive. These activities can be carried later into the day or evening.  Kids may initially balk at this, but when you remind them of the breaks they&amp;rsquo;ve gotten during the day (which they don&amp;rsquo;t get at school), they may be more amenable to the idea of spreading the work out a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;reward-yourself-and-your-kids&#34;&gt;Reward yourself and your kids&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That schedule also allows you to pace work.  For example, if you set yourself a goal to accomplish some task and you complete it earlier than expected (entirely possible when working from home) reward yourself by using the remaining time for your personal interests. And, the same is true for the kids.  If they finish their school work more quickly than the schedule allows, then they have additional freetime that they can use as they choose!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well this really isn&amp;rsquo;t a conclusion.  After all, working from home is a constant learning experience.  But, this is all I have time for today.  I hope that you&amp;rsquo;ve found something interesting and useful to help you as you begin your journey working from home.  I have thoroughly loved my work-at-home experience and honestly can&amp;rsquo;t imagine returning to the office world. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;ve been offered two opportunities to return to the brick-and-mortar classroom in recent months.  I just can&amp;rsquo;t do it. I love working from home far too much!  I hope you do, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Doing the Same Thing And ...</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;doing-the-same-thing-and-&#34;&gt;Doing the Same Thing And &amp;hellip;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve heard the saying &amp;ldquo;the definition insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.&amp;rdquo; And I think you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that this &amp;lsquo;definition&amp;rsquo; is commonly true.  But, what about those times when you do the same thing each and every time and &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; a different result?  That, my friends, is the definition of randomness. And, it&amp;rsquo;s far more common than you think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;doing-the-same-thing-and-&#34;&gt;Doing the Same Thing And &amp;hellip;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve heard the saying &amp;ldquo;the definition insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.&amp;rdquo; And I think you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that this &amp;lsquo;definition&amp;rsquo; is commonly true.  But, what about those times when you do the same thing each and every time and &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; a different result?  That, my friends, is the definition of randomness. And, it&amp;rsquo;s far more common than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicist Leonard Mlodinow, in his book &lt;em&gt;The Drunkard&amp;rsquo;s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives&lt;/em&gt;, Psychologist &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Dan Ariely, in &lt;em&gt;Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions&lt;/em&gt;, Psychologist Daniel Kahneman, in &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt;, and a variety of others whose names I don&amp;rsquo;t now recall, have all pointed to how often randomness injects itself into our lives without our ever realizing its influence. Not only is randomness more common than we realize, we actively reject the notion that something that occurs is simply a random event.  Rather, as Kahneman points out, we often create stories to &amp;ldquo;explain&amp;rdquo; what happens.  It seems we can&amp;rsquo;t simply accept that most of the events in our lives are simply random events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** Randomness, an Example ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the manager that monitors sales in his store. He installed a contraption that counts the number of visitors to his store and uses that as a basis for determining the effectiveness of his sales staff.  Over the past few months he noted that sales tended to hang around 85% of visits.  That is, for every 100 visitors 85% of them became customers by purchasing something.  About four months ago, sales jumped by nearly 7% to 92%. The manager was ecstatic and praised his staff for their hard work.  They all kind of looked at each other because they really hadn&amp;rsquo;t done anything differently. If asked, they would be unable to explain why the sales suddenly increased.  But the manager never asked; he was just happy to see the increase.  To the benefit of the sales staff, the manager assumed that the increase was the result of the employees&amp;rsquo; hard work.  That was his story to explain the increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following month, though, sales were down a bit.  Still higher than the average of 85%, but not at that same nice 92%. It was closer to 87%.  He began to wonder what happened but didn&amp;rsquo;t really say anything.  In the most recent month sales dropped again to 86% of visitors.  Now he is concerned that the staff are resting on their laurels and aren&amp;rsquo;t working as hard to make sales and so he begins to suggest that they need to step it up. After all, if they can do 92% once, they shoud be able to maintain that.  Now, his story to explain the drop in sales is that the staff aren&amp;rsquo;t working hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That manager does not understand how sales work. More specifically he doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand the concept of randomness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sales staff did nothing different in order to achieve that nice 92%. It simply happened.  The steady drop back to 85% is simply what statisticians call &lt;em&gt;regression to the mean&lt;/em&gt;.  Over time random events tend to return to the average.  There is variation in every process. This is most easily seen when a process, such as sales (yes, sales is a process), varies from its normal levels, particularly if the variation is sudden, unexpected, and unexplainable. If there is some clear explanation &amp;ndash; for example, a storm motivates more people to purchase generators than are normally purchased &amp;ndash; then the process itself is not random, though, of course, the cause of the variation (the storm) is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those involved in operations management know that variation is to be expected.  For example, let&amp;rsquo;s suppose you manufacture chocolate chip cookies.  At each step of the process, there is some variation.  So, there might be slight differences in the quantities of ingredients added to each batch of dough, the amount of dough dispensed onto the conveyor that takes the cookies through the oven, and even the &amp;ldquo;doneness&amp;rdquo; of the cookies.  And, of course, not every cookie will have the same number of chocolate chips.  But, in general, all of those variations will be within an acceptable range. That acceptable range is defined by &lt;em&gt;control limits&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; upper and lower limits within which the process is allowed to vary. The idea is that even if all of the variations skewed to one extreme, the product would still meet quality control standards and every cookie will have some tasty chocolate chips in it. Only when the control limits are exceeded are corrective actions taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even though we follow the recipe for chocolate chip cookies every time, there is still a randomness to both the process and the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this might be fairly easy to see in the cookies example, it&amp;rsquo;s often less clear in other situations. Suppose you&amp;rsquo;re shopping in the mall and you become aware that you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the same man several times, in several different stores. That you cross paths several times while in the shopping center is largely a matter of chance &amp;ndash; randomness &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as Kahneman points out, we don&amp;rsquo;t like to accept the simple but true explanation that the variation was simple a random event. We&amp;rsquo;re uncomfortable with that.  Instead, we create a story to explain the event.  When sales are up, the story is that the staff worked harder and deserves reward. When sales are down, the story is that the staff didn&amp;rsquo;t work as hard and should be reprimanded and coaxed into working harder to re-establish those high sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** Making Stories ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books I mentioned earlier all tell the same story: people are uncomfortable accepting that outcomes are most often random and, consequently, create stories that explain the results.  Think about the stock market. Despite what many would claim, the stock market is essentially a random process.  There are a great many factors that may influence the price of a stock on a given day, but over time the stock price is going to fluctuate fairly widely, regardless of whatever else is happening.  We know this is true simply by watching the price of a single stock. Watch the hour to hour changes in stock prices.  Watch the day-to-day and week-to-week changes.  How many of hte changes in the price of that stock can be difinitively linked to some action on the part of management? Not many, if any at all.  Why? Because the changes are random.  Over time stock prices tend to rise. But on a short-term basis there is a great deal of variablity in their prices.  All of that variability is the result of the randomness of the market. And nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** The Effect of Small Samples ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, one of my colleagues was out of work for a bit.  On his return, he was assigned about 1/10th of the students he might normally have during the month.  When the data for the month were analyzed there was much ado about his having achieved a 100% pass rate (the team rate is about 85%).  He received much praise and acknowledgement for his hard work.  Did he deserve it?  Probably not. His situation describes the effect of small numbers &amp;ndash; the smaller the number in a sample, the more more extreme the results tend to be.  For him, the small number of students assigned to him resulted in a significant increase in his pass rate.  It is just as likely that his pass rate could have been 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that last bit confused you, consider this: If you are teaching a class of 500 students, the effect of one student&amp;rsquo;s score on the average score for the class is 0.002 (0.2%). So, the average score for the class is going to be the sum of the individual students&amp;rsquo; scores. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re class only has 100 students in it, then the effect of one student on the overall class score is 0.01(1%) &amp;ndash; five times the impact on the overall average than the student who is one of 500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s reduce that even more.  Let&amp;rsquo;s say your class only has 20 students. Each student has a 0.05  point (5%) impact on the overall score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at how the change in a single students score from in score from 80% to 90% impacts the overall class average:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;Score/Students&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;20 Students&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;100 Students&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;500 Students&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;80%&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;avg: 75&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;avg: 75&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;avg: 75&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;90%&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;avg 75.5&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;avg: 75.1&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;avg 75.02&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this table it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how the number of students affects the impact that one student&amp;rsquo;s grade has on the class average. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re talking about the number of customers, the number of students, the number of cats, or the number of hotdogs as the subject of the statistical analysis, the simple fact is that the fewer subjects you include in your statistics the greater the individual&amp;rsquo;s impact will be on the final result.  This means, of course, that with fewer subjects, you are more likely to see extreme results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is what managers tend to overlook. Rather than considering the effect of smaller numbers on the results, they celebrate (or punish) the employee&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rsquo;effectiveness&amp;rsquo;, even if the employee did nothing to bring about that outcome. The manager creates a story to explain the employee&amp;rsquo;s performance even when there is no basis for the story.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Evolution of an Academic</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-evolution-of-an-academic&#34;&gt;The Evolution of an Academic&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had someone told me on the day of my high school graduation in 1977 that I would one day be an academic, in possession of a doctoral degree and teaching at the university level, I&amp;rsquo;d have warned them that whatever&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; they were smoking was muddling their brain. Yet, here I am, forty years later, in possession of not one, but two master&amp;rsquo;s degrees, and a doctorate, teaching at a university.  How did that happen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-evolution-of-an-academic&#34;&gt;The Evolution of an Academic&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had someone told me on the day of my high school graduation in 1977 that I would one day be an academic, in possession of a doctoral degree and teaching at the university level, I&amp;rsquo;d have warned them that whatever&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; they were smoking was muddling their brain. Yet, here I am, forty years later, in possession of not one, but two master&amp;rsquo;s degrees, and a doctorate, teaching at a university.  How did that happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-wasnt-planned&#34;&gt;It Wasn&amp;rsquo;t Planned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never planned to go to college.  As a high school student, I hated school.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much that I disliked learning. Rather, it was that I disliked the structure and rigidity of the scholastic environment.  I was, and am, curious (hence the title of this blog). I loved learning about things that caught my interest.  As a teen I became interested in solar power and, to this day, I can tell you that the proper angle for a solar panel is latitude plus or minus 15 degrees, depending on the season. I learned that tidbit of information somewhere around age 17 and it has never left me. And, I&amp;rsquo;ve always read on a variety of topics.  Even as a elementary school student I was interested in topics such as psychology and anthropology, pondering on why cultures were different, for example, and read on those topics&amp;ndash; at least as well as a fifth grader could!  But I hated the imposed structure of learning that schooling provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I was graduating from high school I was done. No more school for me!  So, I went to work.  Now, it&amp;rsquo;s important to recognize that in the mid-1970&amp;rsquo;s a college education was nice to have but wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary for most jobs.  Someone could easily get a wide variety of jobs that paid a decent wage, allowing a relatively good middle-class living, without having attended college.  But things were changing.  After a year of working, I realized that the really well-paying jobs required an associate degree.  So, off to the community college I went. I had no idea what I wanted to do. So, like so many others, I chose a business admin major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After blundering through a few business courses, however, I realized that the topic didn&amp;rsquo;t hold much interest to me so I started digging around.  I learned about this intriguing career called a Physician&amp;rsquo;s Assistant (PA).  I shifted my focus a bit and found a job as an orderly in the local hospital to help me decide if healthcare was appealing to me. I talked to a couple of PAs who, to my dismay, presented a less than rosey picture of the future of the PA. They were wrong, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the PA picture was looking rather bleak, I also met and worked with a number of men who were nurses. When I had been working in a small local grocer, the owner&amp;rsquo;s wife was working on her degree in nursing and suggested that I consider that.  I thought she was nuts; nursing was for women.  But, having met and worked with several men in nursing, and having gotten their whole-hearted endorsements of the field as appropriate for men, I thought, &amp;ldquo;why not?&amp;rdquo;  I changed my major and off I went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to say here that in making that choice I found that my grades improved.  Having a clearly defined goal certainly helped me to focus my energies toward my studies.  I took, and passed with good grades, all of the biological studies the community college offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having already earned the hours for an associates degree, it made little sense to spend another two years getting an AD in nursing, so I chose, instead, to pursue a BSN.  I applied to, and was accepted, into a BSN program.  I can&amp;rsquo;t say it was always a pleasant two years, but at least I had a focus and was successful in my studies.  And by 1983 I was a full-fledged licensed, RN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-next-stagse&#34;&gt;The Next Stagse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing my degree and passing the licensing exam I went to work in a Coronary Care Unit.  I generally like the work and soon found that I wanted more.  In this case, I thought that I wanted to move into administration.  To that end, I began work on a Masters in Business Administration and by 1992, and two schools later, I had acheived that goal. I went to work as an administrator in home health.  And hated it.  It didn&amp;rsquo;t take me long to realize that my personality didn&amp;rsquo;t suit the world of management well.  Still, I persisted in working in healthcare, returning to my roots as an RN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the realization that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t great management material, there were still areas within management that intrigued me and I found myself drawn to reading and studying those topics. I had begun my studies in the mid-1980s &amp;ndash; just when computers were really beginning to show up in the workplace. They definitely piqued my curiosity and soon I was off playing with computers, learning how to program and how the darn things worked.  This fit into my general curiosity of all things technical.  I loved computers and exploring all the things you could do with them.  I still do, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1990s I returned to school again, first for a masters in nursing (with the notion of becoming a nurse practitioner) and later as a masters in information systems (to answer my interest in computers). Both of those pursuits were derailed by social and family issues that got in the way of my studies and prevented me from completing.  For the MSN, in particular, a fading interest in becoming an NP was also a factor.  It always saddened me that I never completed the MIS degree (even though I possess now much of the knowledge and skills that the degree would have provided me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through out this time, I continued to read and study in a variety of topic areas.  I remained an avid reader of both fiction and non-fiction.  It was rare that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have some book at hand, and visits to bookstores were a weekly occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transition-to-teaching&#34;&gt;Transition to Teaching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working at a small hospital, I had the opportunity to take on the role of nurse educator for the facilty. I found not only that I enjoyed the work but that I apparently had a penchant for communicating concepts in a clear and concise manner.  I was a good teacher.  That experience, and the realization that it engendered, led me to explore the possiblity of teaching in an academic setting.  I applied for, and was accepted, as an instructor in an LPN program.  This I did for for nearly 10 years, with a two year interlude in which I taught health science in a high school (that experienced confirmed for me that secondary education was NOT a viable option for me!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed teaching LPN students.  As I continued in that role, I found that my perspective on teaching and learning about nursing was changing.  I also found that I was more introspective. I gave thought to how I taught. I sought out information on how to teach more effectively and efficiently.  My approaches evolved from the &amp;ldquo;sage on the stagse&amp;rdquo; approach that I had grown up with, to a more interactive approach.  And, I became more aware of the value of education beyond simple career training.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t just want to teach students how to do the job, I wanted to teach them how to think.  I had begun to realize that the more knowledge you have, the better able you are to make sense of your life, to make better and more informed decisions.  Limiting yourself to knowledge only within the work domain limits your ability to grow and find value as a person.  I came to realize that I wanted to teach at a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To teach beyond the LPN level, however, requires a masters degree or higher.  So, back to school I went.  Nearing completion of my MSN, I decided that a doctorate would open more doors. Not only did it open more doors for me, the doctorate also opened my eyes and mind to new ways of thinking.  The experience profoundly affected my sense of self and how I view my world.  Through my doctoral work I began to realize just how limited my own worldview had been.  I began to read even more widely and more deeply on a range of subjects.  I began to think about how critical the skills of thinking and reading were to success not only in nursing, but in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common complaint of my students, most of whom are practicing RNs who are being forced back to school for their BSN by their employers, is that they don&amp;rsquo;t see how the BSN helps them to become a better nurse.  I can answer that now.  How can adding more knowledge, regardless of the type of knowledge, not help you be more effective in working with others?  How can knowledge not help you to see connections between ideas and experiences?  How can knowledge of disparate concepts not help you to develop your own ideas more fully?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I am. A teacher &amp;ndash; an academic. Even, perhaps, a bit of a scholar. This is not where I expected life to take me, but here is where I have found a sense of fulfillment. Mihaly Csikcszentmihaly, in his book &lt;em&gt;Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience&lt;/em&gt; describes the sense of oneness one feels when things are as they should be in life.  I think, in becoming an academic, I have found my flow.  I have found my purpose in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy, am I surprised!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The ONE THING</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-one-thing/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-one-thing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-one-thing&#34;&gt;The ONE THING&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love to read and love to learn, so it is no suprise that one of my favorite pastimes is to wander through bookstores. I love perusing the titles, skimming a few pages of those that interest me and maybe marking a few to add to my reading list. It&amp;rsquo;s a habit I developed probably thirty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the subject areas I generally skim is the business management section. Learning about management styles and techniques is interesting and informative.  Last fall, however, as  I was skimming titles, I had an epihany.  As I skimmed the titles I became aware of just how many titles purported to embue the reader &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;with &amp;ldquo;the one thing&amp;rdquo; that they could do to be the best leader, the best manager, to build the most successful company, and &amp;hellip; well, you get the idea. As I looked further, I found books of similar types in other subject areas.  It seems that everyone one is looking for the ONE THING that gives them an advantagse. The problem was that in skimming the books it quickly became apparent that the &amp;ldquo;one thing&amp;rdquo; differed from book to book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The problem was that in skimming the books it quickly became apparent that the &amp;ldquo;one thing&amp;rdquo; differed from book to book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-could-that-be&#34;&gt;How Could That Be?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I pondered this situation, a couple of explanations came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first explanation is that there are many road to the same outcome.  That is, despite the author&amp;rsquo;s assertion that his or her approach was the &amp;ldquo;one best way&amp;rdquo;, perhaps there were other, equally effective ways of acheiving first-rate outcomes. The author simply chose a title that he or she hoped would sell more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second explanation is that maybe the &amp;ldquo;one best way&amp;rdquo; worked for this manager, in this organization.  Whether or not it would work for a different manager, with a different management style, in a different organizational environment is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third explanation (yes, I know that &amp;ldquo;a couple&amp;rdquo; means two), and the one that I most agree with, is that all those books are just a bunch of hooey.  There is no one best way that applies to everyone.  The titles, and, indeed the premise on which they are based, are aimed at selling books and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last gains some support from psychologist Daniel Kahneman who notes that humans love stories and abhor the unexplained.  So we look for stories to explain why a particular business appears to be successful while another fails.  We look for stories to explain why one person is hugely successful while another, even with similar talents and abilities, fails miserably.  And, it seems, that&amp;rsquo;s what most (if not all) of these books are: stories to explain success or failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;theyre-just-stories&#34;&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re Just Stories&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three problems with these stories.  First, the stories are always rendered in hindsight.  It is much easier to explain success or failure after the fact. Whether or not the success or failure was predicted (or could have been) beforehand is a different story. this suggests that &amp;ldquo;the one thing&amp;rdquo; is not so much a truism as it is an interpretation designed to explain the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the stories almost invariably omit the factors that don&amp;rsquo;t fit the narrative. That is, a story that explains why TheCompany was so successful omits the myriad blunders and failed attempts that occurred along the way.  Or, if the story is about a person, the story may omit the obvious strokes of luck that occurred as part of that success story. If Bill Gates was 10 years older, or 10 years younger than he is, no one would have heard of him.  His luck was in being at the right place at the right time with the right skillset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third problem is that rarely is an event the result of some single factor. There is no ONE THING.  We humans are a lazy bunch.  We want things presented to us in simple, easily digested bites.  We don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear that the success of one company was based on the interaction of dozens of factors while that of another was based on the interactions of dozens of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; factors.  The two companies might share some of those factors, but not all of them, yet they were both successful.  And we certainly don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear that changes to any one of those factors might well have doomed the company rather than ensuring its success. That&amp;rsquo;s way too complicated and we don&amp;rsquo;t like complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;so-whats-my-point&#34;&gt;So, What&amp;rsquo;s My Point?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I have two points to make, really. The first is that the world is a complicated place that cannot be easily boiled down to simple rules.  That means that success can come from many factors, or the interaction of many factors, but rarely can be attributed to a single all-encompassing idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point is that reading these books is interesting, thought-provoking, and even inspirational. But they don&amp;rsquo;t explain anything.  They are simply interesting stories that reflect one person&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of the facts, after the fact, that they invented to explain success or failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read them with a large dose of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s Wrong With Asking for a &#34;Highly Satisfied&#34; Rating</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/whats-wrong-with-asking-for-a-highly-satisfied-rating/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/whats-wrong-with-asking-for-a-highly-satisfied-rating/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-wrong-with-asking-for-a-highly-satisified-rating&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Wrong with Asking for a &amp;ldquo;Highly Satisified&amp;rdquo; Rating?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtually all businesses today are concerned about how the public perceives them.  They recognize &amp;ndash; and rightfully so, in my opinion &amp;ndash; that customers who have a positive experience, who receive great service, or receive quality, tasty foods are more likely to be repeat customers.  They also know that customers who have a poor experience are just as unlikely to return.  Thus, measuring the customer experience by asking the customer to complete a survey of their experience is an important means for getting information on how&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; well the company is doing in meeting the customers&amp;rsquo; needs and expectations.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure all managers understand the value of the survey and the need for accurate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-wrong-with-asking-for-a-highly-satisified-rating&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Wrong with Asking for a &amp;ldquo;Highly Satisified&amp;rdquo; Rating?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtually all businesses today are concerned about how the public perceives them.  They recognize &amp;ndash; and rightfully so, in my opinion &amp;ndash; that customers who have a positive experience, who receive great service, or receive quality, tasty foods are more likely to be repeat customers.  They also know that customers who have a poor experience are just as unlikely to return.  Thus, measuring the customer experience by asking the customer to complete a survey of their experience is an important means for getting information on how&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; well the company is doing in meeting the customers&amp;rsquo; needs and expectations.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure all managers understand the value of the survey and the need for accurate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-surveys-are-important&#34;&gt;Why Surveys Are Important&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a competitive marketplace reputation is important.  Reputation is the amalgam of the customer experience. Everything from the taste, temperature, and presentation of the food, to the friendliness of staff, the speed with which the food is delivered, and even the cleanliness of the environment, all play a role in reputation.  In retail businesses such as Wal-Mart or Target, the quality of the food may not be of value, but the abilty to easily navigate the aisles, or to locate a desired product, would be.  The simple fact is that your company may provide the best food in town, but if the service sucks, your reputation will sink you quickly. And, once the reputation is established it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer surveys can provide management with insight into what the customer values and to how well the business is meeting that expectation.  If you want to improve, you pay attention to the feedback customers provide.  But that feedback needs to be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-ask&#34;&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Ask&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was immediately struck by the inanity of that message.  I doubt whether McDonalds corporate authorized that message. After all, they are spending money to collect and analyze the data from the survey, and providing incentives for completing it &amp;ndash; regardless of what ratings are applied. To ask for a specific rating invalidates the survey, wasting all the money they&amp;rsquo;ve invested in the process.  That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make sense from a corporate perspective.  Businesses want and need valid customer feedback, as I said earlier.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that McDonald&amp;rsquo;s corporate didn&amp;rsquo;t authorize the message, I am left with a couple of other possible explanations and to some degree they may be interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, the management of this particular store does not understand the value of customer feedback.  It could be that the manager either never received or did not pay attention to the training on the value and utility of accurate customer feedback.  Alternately, they may simply have received bad training from the git go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, it could be that the manager fully understands the value of feedback but also knows that some issues, such as service quality are the result of in-store cultures and, as a result, realizes the challenges faced with changing that culture.  It&amp;rsquo;s easier to ask customers to provide false feedback than to address the issues that could organically lead to improved customer experiences in the store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A third option is that the management in that store simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t care.  They would rather bribe customers to get high ratings than to actually do the work of improving their service and quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;undermining-their-own-intentions&#34;&gt;Undermining Their Own Intentions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fourth possibility is that corporate messaging may lead to misunderstanding the goals of the survey, or actually change the purpose of the survey unintentionally.  In my experience, it is pretty common for businesses to say one thing but then take steps that undermine their words.  Because businesses often don&amp;rsquo;t fully think through their actions, they fail to recognize and adjust for the potential unintentional consequences of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume, for example, that McDonalds is sincere in their desire to improve the quality of food and service in their stores. They initiate the customer feedback system to gain insights into the customer experience and expectations.  Along with this effort, they implement a rewards system that rewards stores for high ratings.  Sounds good, right?  Providing incentives to earn highly satisfied ratings might help improve the experience. Or, it could simply lead to managers asking customers to give high ratings, bribing them to do so. The unintentional effect of providing incentives to managers for their high ratings leads to the managers gaming the system to ensure they get those incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does the customer experience not improve, but the company no longer has a valid way to determine what that customer experience is.  The data are tainted.  In my view, the results of surveys should not be tied either to incentives or punishment (the other direction some businesses tend to go).  Rather, the surveys should be presented to management for what they are &amp;ndash; opportunities to improve the success of the business through its focus on the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-did-i-do-with-that-survey&#34;&gt;What Did I do With That Survey?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually completed the survey with the specific goal of expressing my displeasure at the &amp;ldquo;bribe&amp;rdquo; that was offered.  Interestingly, even though I did not provide &amp;ldquo;Highly Satisfied&amp;rdquo; responses to my survey, I was given a code for that free item.  So, it appears that a &amp;ldquo;highly satisfied&amp;rdquo; rating was not required for the incentive, but you don&amp;rsquo;t find that out until you&amp;rsquo;ve provided the high ratings.  It seems the company was simply providing an incentive to customers to provide feedback.  The manager decided to leverage that incentive to ensure high ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That manager needs retraining &amp;ndash; and not just on on the value of customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updates on Technology Projects</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;updates-to-technology-projects&#34;&gt;Updates to Technology Projects&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had several technology projects running for a while now and thought it was time for an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nextcloud-onlyoffice-and-the-like&#34;&gt;Nextcloud, OnlyOffice, and the Like&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in February I set up a Nextcloud server and incorporated OnlyOffice.  The concepts are pretty cool, but I have abandoned both of those projects.  In all honesty, having completed my dissertation, I write so little that requires a word processor that I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet found a need for OnlyOffice. And when I do need such &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;services, I have LibreOffice available on all of my computers.  MS Office is on its way out since I no longer need to power of a word processor for my writing and my licenses are beginning to expire. (I still have a couple of licenses that will be expiring soon.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Back in February I set up a Nextcloud server and incorporated OnlyOffice.  The concepts are pretty cool, but I have abandoned both of those projects.  In all honesty, having completed my dissertation, I write so little that requires a word processor that I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet found a need for OnlyOffice. And when I do need such &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;services, I have LibreOffice available on all of my computers.  MS Office is on its way out since I no longer need to power of a word processor for my writing and my licenses are beginning to expire. (I still have a couple of licenses that will be expiring soon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of document storage, I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out what benefit Nextclod provides me over a simple document storage device such as my linux server.  I can access everything I need via the VPN.  This approach not only helps keep my data more secure by not opening it to the web, but just streamlines the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jekyll&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another project I started back in the fall was to use Jekyll for my website.  I am quite conversant in database design, management, etc and fully understand the benefits that a database e.g.  Mysql, postresql, etc can provide.  On the other hand, I also know how difficult it is to move your writing to another platform or to simply extract your work in a human-readable way.  The promise of Jekyll and other plaintext platforms is that you can write and store your writing in a human readable format that can easily be moved to different platforms, printed, or otherwise shared with ease. As you may infer from this site, however, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to Grav, which is a bit more intuitive and easier to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several factors led to that decision.  Probably the most signficant is that creating a new post required too many steps.  Not only did I have to write and store the document in a specific location, I then had to run a script that would recompile the entire site, then upload the entire site to the webserver.  That doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to me. And, to accomplish this required that I either remember the various commands for compiling the site and uploading it, or remember where I put the script that would run the commands for me.  If it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a post, there was no guarantee that I&amp;rsquo;d remember these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grav provides an option to use the writing tools through the admin page of the website to write, or I can write off-line and simply upload the one file to the server.  No fuss, no muss, and the page is immediately live.  Grav may present a little bigger hit on the server itself as it processes the page, but probably no more so than would be seen if I was using a database driven site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did look at several alternatives, including YellowCMS, and Bludit.  I actually liked Bludit quite a lot and would have chosen it but for the fact that it lacked the ability to simply upload a page written offline.  It stores its page data in a JSON database file which would have required that I either write all my posts within the site, or manually update several JSON files in order to get everything set up correctly.  Not an appealing prospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;self-hosted-bookmark-site&#34;&gt;Self-Hosted Bookmark Site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three projects that are rocking along well are the self-hosted bookmark, the RSS reader, and the read-it-later sites that I created.  Both of these run on a Raspberry Pi and work very well. In fact, I use all three relatively routinely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shaarli&#34;&gt;Shaarli&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After playing with several other scripts (Unmark, SemanticScuttle, and Shaarl, as well as a couple of others that I don&amp;rsquo;t now remember) I settled on Shaarli.  I can&amp;rsquo;t really say why, other than it seems to be the one that best meshed with how I work.  SemanticScuttle is still up and running and I do have bookmarks stored there, but I rarely send anything to it.  For this one, Shaarli wins the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;freshrss&#34;&gt;FreshRSS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I really wrote about an RSS reader earlier but I played with several over the course of several months.  I realize that RSS reader use may be on the decline but I like being able to quickly scan headlines of my favorite sites.  I have to manually mark the entries read and to manually refresh the page to update the headlines, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay.  I find FreshRSS useful and that&amp;rsquo;s what counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;wallabag&#34;&gt;Wallabag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was there ever a question that Wallabag would persist? Not for me.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I never really cottoned to Pocket.  It does the same thing as Wallabag, but for whatever reason I find Wallabag useful.  I try to keep my reading list there pruned so I don&amp;rsquo;t end up with hundreds of unread pages.  But being able to save not only the bookmark to a page, but also the content of that page is quite useful.  I also like that the advertising is stripped from the pages and they are made more readable and easier to print if  I want to keep a hard-copy of a particular article.  Pocket may have those capacities (I&amp;rsquo;m sure they do) but Wallabag is the service for me and it runs on my servers, keeping things simple and ensuring that they won&amp;rsquo;t suddenly disappear when the company goes under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it: updates to several of my technology projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Science Fiction and the Polymath</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;science-fiction-and-the-polymath&#34;&gt;Science Fiction and the Polymath&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my junior high years I was a huge science fiction fan.  One of my favorite authors of the time was  Isaac Asimov.  I was quite surprised to learn that Asimov not only wrote science fiction but had also penned books, short stories, and essays that ranged from religion (Guide to the Bible), chemistry (he was educated as a biochemist), engineering, and the list goes on.  This realization intially confused me.  How &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;could a science fiction writer be so bold as to write on so many different topics? How could he know enough in each of those fields to qualify himself to write books on them?  It would be many years before I encountered the term &amp;ldquo;polymath&amp;rdquo;, but surely Asimov earned the title.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;science-fiction-and-the-polymath&#34;&gt;Science Fiction and the Polymath&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my junior high years I was a huge science fiction fan.  One of my favorite authors of the time was  Isaac Asimov.  I was quite surprised to learn that Asimov not only wrote science fiction but had also penned books, short stories, and essays that ranged from religion (Guide to the Bible), chemistry (he was educated as a biochemist), engineering, and the list goes on.  This realization intially confused me.  How &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;could a science fiction writer be so bold as to write on so many different topics? How could he know enough in each of those fields to qualify himself to write books on them?  It would be many years before I encountered the term &amp;ldquo;polymath&amp;rdquo;, but surely Asimov earned the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a few weeks ago.  I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really given Asimov &amp;ndash; or science fiction &amp;ndash; a whole lot of thought in many years.  I would still occasionally read a sci-fi story or watch a few sci-fi films or TV shows, but for the the most part, I had set aside my interest.  Too many other demands on my time. Then I ran across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/531911/isaac-asimov-asks-how-do-people-get-new-ideas/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article in which Asimov explores how people get new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the points he makes in that article is that new ideas are born by combining old ideas in new ways.  That is, seeing connections between old ideas that others seem to have missed. Implicit in his explanation is that in order for one to create new ideas, one must first be conversant in a range of old ideas.  Logically, the more &amp;lsquo;old&amp;rsquo; knowledge you have, the more likely you are to develop some new idea. After all, the more knowledge you have, the greater are the opportunities for connections to be made between two or more of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That realization also underscores the need for a broad education.  Today the tendency, even at the university level, is to focus on knowledge and skills that translate into a career path. Now, there are a number of issues with that which I won&amp;rsquo;t go into here, but one problem with this perspective of education is highlighted by Asimov&amp;rsquo;s observation.  The more knowledge you have on a broad range of subjects, the more likely you are to make a connection that leads to new ideas and new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a youngster, it made little sense to me that a writer of science fiction should spend his time in all of these disparate areas.  As an adult and an educator, it makes perfect sense.  Science fiction is a nearly perfect vehicle for exploring and questioning the range of human experience.  By creating &amp;rsquo;new worlds&amp;rsquo; and new civilizations, the sci-fi writer gives him or herself the license to explore ideas.  She is not bound to the current cultural norms; she can create her own.  To do that, though, the writer must first have an understanding of cultures and how they develop.  To develop new worlds, the writer must first develop an appreciation for how those worlds might be different.  To create and convincingly describe new technologies, the writer has to have at least a foundational understanding of the physics, chemistry, and/or engineering involved in those technologies.  To create new languages (as JRR Tolkien did) the writer must have an understanding of languages and linguistics. In short, the science fiction writer must be well-versed in a wide range of knowledge domains. That is, the writer most likely is a polymath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is a polymath? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polymath&#34;&gt; Merriam-Webster&lt;/a&gt; defines a polymath as someone who knows a lot about a lot of different things; someone of encyclopedic knowledge.  From other readings, those whom we consider to be polymaths are highly curious and are constantly exploring new areas of knowledge. They want the knowledge for the sake of knowing, and without any particular purpose.  But I think it&amp;rsquo;s more than that.  I think that a true polymath not only knows a lot about many different things, but is also able to combine that knowledge in the creation of new knowledge. And this is what science fiction writers often do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Me? A Manager? Not So Much</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/me-a-manager-not-so-much/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/me-a-manager-not-so-much/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;me-a-manager-not-so-much&#34;&gt;Me? A Manager? Not so Much&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year or so my manager has
been after me to move into a management role.  I managed to avoid doing so until
fairly recently, using my work on my doctorate as an excuse for not really
having the time to take on all the work of learning the role, learning the
courses I would manage and so forth.  Recently, however, I was approached again
and, having all-but completed my degree, really didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good reason for&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;me-a-manager-not-so-much&#34;&gt;Me? A Manager? Not so Much&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year or so my manager has
been after me to move into a management role.  I managed to avoid doing so until
fairly recently, using my work on my doctorate as an excuse for not really
having the time to take on all the work of learning the role, learning the
courses I would manage and so forth.  Recently, however, I was approached again
and, having all-but completed my degree, really didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good reason for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t get the job.  Exactly why, though, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. I do know that they had
multiple applicants and no one was chosen.  That&amp;rsquo;s fine.  That experience,
though, got me to really thinking about whether I really wanted to continue to
pursue a management position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-answer-is-no&#34;&gt;The Answer is &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty common, I think, for people to expect that as you gain experience in
a field that you&amp;rsquo;ll want to move up within that field.  For most people, that
means moving into management.  And, if that&amp;rsquo;s truly where you want to be, that&amp;rsquo;s
a good plan.  But, when people begin to expect you to move up and you don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ndash;
particularly by choice &amp;ndash; they begin to wonder why not.  Why, they ask, aren&amp;rsquo;t
you interested in growing?  Or, why don&amp;rsquo;t you want to improve yourself?  Some
organizations even set the expectation that you either express a desire to move
&amp;lsquo;up the ladder&amp;rsquo; or move on.  They (wrongfully) equate a lack of desire to &amp;lsquo;move
up&amp;rsquo; with a lack of motivation to do good work.  They are very short-sighted.
Ignorant, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing in my own case.  I began pursuit of my doctorate not because I
wanted to
become a manager but because I wanted to teach.  It really doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to
get a degree that fully qualifies me to teach and then abandon teaching for
management.  Perhaps as importantly, management is simply not me. I&amp;rsquo;ve done
management.  I have a degree in management.  I&amp;rsquo;m not a good manager. My manager
disagrees and that&amp;rsquo;s okay.  The problem is that he is evaluating my life through
his lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the simple fact that leadership and management are often seen as
being the same thing. They
are not.  I am a good leader.  I have good ideas, I see ways that things can be
done differently and more effectively, and I am good a communicating those
thoughts.  I look at things through a different lens, which allows me to present
alternative ways of seeing and approaching things.  And, because I am both good
at expressing those thoughts and pretty much unafraid to bring up questions,
others listen to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, just because I am a good leader doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;ll be a good manager.  The
requisite skills are different.  Perhaps more importantly, the constraints on
the two roles are different.  As a manager I am constrained to present the
organization&amp;rsquo;s perspective in a positive light, at least to those under my
management.  As a simple employee, I&amp;rsquo;m free to voice my frustrations and
disagreements with the &amp;lsquo;company view&amp;rsquo;. That can be dangerous, but is less likely
to garner significant backlash than if I did so as a manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;academics-and-management&#34;&gt;Academics and Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t speak for anyone other than myself, so that heading is a bit misleading.&lt;br&gt;
But, it seems to me that academics go into education for one of three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, they genuinely enjoy teaching. They enjoy the interaction with
students.
They love to see that &amp;ldquo;ah ha!&amp;rdquo; look in the students&amp;rsquo; faces when the students
connect the
dots and a concept crystallizes for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, they are curious (I&amp;rsquo;ll write
more about that later) and academia allows them to satisfy that curiosity and
to share the fruits of their curiosity with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, I know at least
some people who come into education more as an avoidance of or escape from some
unpleasant work experience than for any particular desire to educate.  This
third group may also include people who can simply no longer function in the
workplace due to age or infirmity.  Nurses, for example, may come into teaching
more because they can no longer physically do the work of nursing. There&amp;rsquo;s
nothing wrong with that, though they may not be the most effective educators.  I
do disagree with the old saw that &amp;ldquo;Them what can, do; Them what can&amp;rsquo;t, teach.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s true.  In my experience, teaching is simply an expression
of what drives the individual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these reasons points to the need for a position in management.  It&amp;rsquo;s not
about power or authority. It&amp;rsquo;s about sharing with others and exploring one&amp;rsquo;s own
interests. It&amp;rsquo;s not about growing into more &amp;lsquo;responsible&amp;rsquo; positions (whatever
that means), it&amp;rsquo;s about growing in understanding and insight and
accomplishments. I don&amp;rsquo;t see the ability to manage others or to implement the
plans and goals of others as necessarily being growth. Nor do I see stifling my
own perspectives, interests, and curiosity in order to meet some vague corporate
conception of what I should be as a desirable thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I&amp;rsquo;ve given it thought and I will not be pursuing management anytime in
the foreseeable future.  I want to grow, but as a person and as an intellectual,
not as a minion to those with more titular &amp;lsquo;power&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Power of Curiosity</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-power-of-curiosity/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-power-of-curiosity&#34;&gt;The Power of Curiosity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been a curious person. I&amp;rsquo;m the kid that took toys apart to see how they worked (and was sometimes able to put them back together again, too!) I was the kid that enjoyed reading the &lt;em&gt;WorldBook Encyclopedia&lt;/em&gt; because, well, just because. Learning about different stuff fascinated me.  Even as a very small child I was curious.  My mother used to tell the story of the time when I was maybe 3 or 4 years old and came in crying because my eyes were filled with sand.  I had apparently held a toy over my head and looked up&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; as the sand fell out because I wanted to see what it looked like from that angle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had apparently held a toy over my head and looked up&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; as the sand fell out because I wanted to see what it looked like from that angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that curiosity persists within me today. My wife becomes exasperated with me because I tend to bounce around to different ideas, interests, and activities.  Today I&amp;rsquo;m learning a new programming language, tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m studying Spanish, then next day I&amp;rsquo;m reading some philosophical treatise.  Or business. Or economics. Or &amp;hellip; Or &amp;hellip; Or. Did I say I like to learn stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently I&amp;rsquo;ve read two books that have at least provided some consolation that perhaps my natural inclination toward epistemic meandering is neither uncommon nor bad for me.  Mario Livio, an astrophysicist and author of several books on mathematics and physics, wrote the book &lt;em&gt;Why? What Makes Us Curious.&lt;/em&gt; In it Livio shares with the reader how many well-known figures such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Richard Feynman, and a host of others had wide ranging interests and who often became fascinated by some topic only to drop it once their curiosity had been sated, or the specific question they sought to answer had been answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Leslie, an author and journalist, took a similar approach to curiosity in his book, &lt;em&gt;Curious: The Desire to Know and Why Your Future Depends on It.&lt;/em&gt; Now, having read the book I think the title is a bit hyperbolic, but he does make a number of valid points regarding the importance of curiosity in learning and how what is learned leads to ever more curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, both of these books surface a set of ideas that I&amp;rsquo;ve had floating around in my mind for a number of years. The idea that we should focus on one thing is exactly the wrong approach. In the book &lt;em&gt;Freakonomics&lt;/em&gt;, author and economist Steven Levitt told the story of how, when he was being considered for a faculty position, some of those on the committee questioned his program of research.  Typically, an program of research is focused on a single topic area.  This was not the case for Levitt. That is, in his research he was not developing a body of knowledge within a limited field of study but was, instead, researching and writing more broadly. He argued that everything is, in some way, connected and that he, therefore, was well within his rights to explore them.  Bottom line: he as curious and he acted on that curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curiosity-leads-to-new-discoveries&#34;&gt;Curiosity Leads to New Discoveries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Levitt did was to take an immense curiosity, accumulate knowledge of broad fields and find connections between them.  Levitt exemplified the concepts that both Livio and Leslie described.  Curiosity prompts us to question and to explore.  Those actions, in turn, add to our knowledge base. Our brain, then, takes that information and begins to build connections. In this way new knowledge is created and new understandings are achieved.  Without that broad knowledge base, it is nearly impossible to see connections that lead to know understandings and insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses want to exploit new ideas but create environments that, ultimately, work against that very desire.  Many employers either actively, or out of ignorance, create environments that stifle &amp;ndash; and sometimes actively discourage &amp;ndash; the very thing they claim the want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll write more about that in my next post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;nextcloud-onlyoffice-and-the-like&#34;&gt;Nextcloud, OnlyOffice, and the Like&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while I get this notion that I need to move my data off of sites
like Dropbox, OneDrive, and so forth. When I do, I start playing around with
self-hosted services such as NextCloud, OwnCloud, and so forth. I&amp;rsquo;m currently in
one of those cycles and have been playing around a good bit with Nextcloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while I get this notion that I need to move my data off of sites
like Dropbox, OneDrive, and so forth. When I do, I start playing around with
self-hosted services such as NextCloud, OwnCloud, and so forth. I&amp;rsquo;m currently in
one of those cycles and have been playing around a good bit with Nextcloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve even coupled it with OnlyOffice so that I can edit documents in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where I am right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-setup&#34;&gt;My Current Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me say upfront that I use OneDrive for most of my document storage. That
came about partly because I use a Microsoft Surface, as well as a Windows laptop
that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a large storage capacity.  Being able to write a document in
Word and send it straight to the cloud service, and then to have that document
available from any computer I work on (I have several) is a great convenience.&lt;br&gt;
Now, it&amp;rsquo;s important, here, to note that I actually have two OneDrive accounts:
The 5 GB free one and a 1 TB paid service through my Office365 account. I
actually use the paid account as my Exchange server more than for file storage,
but that option is available to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my documents, though, are saved to a Linux-based local network file
server. All of my computers are attached to that file server so that I can
access my files from that machine. The OneDrive folder that is synced to to
cloud service actually lives on that local server and is mapped to a drive on my
Windows laptop.  This ensures both that I have local access and have a backup of
those files I consider critical. (They&amp;rsquo;re also backed up locally to another
computer.)  Ensuring that those critical files are backed up off site is
important
and one of the arguments I have against self-hosted &amp;ldquo;cloud services&amp;rdquo;. What is
the point of &amp;ldquo;self-hosting&amp;rdquo; if you&amp;rsquo;re then going to back up those same files to
an online backup service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the arguments that I frequently hear is that these services allow me to
access my files from anywhere. This is true.  And, if I&amp;rsquo;m not on my own computer
( a rare occurrence), this can be a very important, even critical, feature.  In
my case, though, I have all of my mobile devices set to access my local network
through a VPN. My Ubiquiti Edgerouter X made setting up that VPN almost trivial
and works flawlessly.  So, so long as I have one of my mobile devices, I can
access my internal network and all the files available there.  No need for a
webservice to provide that intermediate layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;privacy-concerns&#34;&gt;Privacy Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most of the online discussions surrounding these types of self-hosted
services, the primary reason for moving from a &amp;ldquo;cloud host&amp;rdquo; to a self-hosted
solution is privacy.  After all, we don&amp;rsquo;t want those big, bad companies mining
our files for information.  As I considered this argument, though, I had to come
to the conclusion that it didn&amp;rsquo;t really matter to me.  First of all, there&amp;rsquo;s
really nothing in my files that I feel is so important that it needs to be
secured.  If I have such files (various bills and statements come to mind), I
don&amp;rsquo;t put them in my Dropbox or OneDrive folder.  They live in a local folder.
Most of what I store in the online services are downloaded PDF files or
documents that
I received through my educational experiences.  Those are already generally
publicly available. And, while they might provide some insight into what
interests me, they would hardly provide anything that could be considered
compromising.  So, privacy, at least for me, isn&amp;rsquo;t much of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, having said that, I do have to concede one area that could become
problematic from the privacy perspective.  I write a lot.  Most of it is for
working out my own thoughts and ideas.  Some of it is part of various projects
that I&amp;rsquo;m working on (stories, or my dissertation, for example). Although not
sensitive in the sense of compromising my privacy, these writings do involve
some levels of
copyright.  Should my online account at one of these big providers be
compromised, my claim to copyright on these documents could be compromised.  The
likelihood of that occurring is minimal, but it is, nonetheless, a risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;security&#34;&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security, to me, is part of, but separate from, privacy.  A secure service
protects my privacy, to be sure.  But what I&amp;rsquo;m referring to here is protecting
my work from loss.  If I have files that I truly do not want to lose, I want to
ensure that I&amp;rsquo;ve got them saved in multiple places so that I can be sure that I
don&amp;rsquo;t lose them.  As I mentioned earlier in this post, I have taken measures to
ensure that my important files are backed up to another computer in the event
that my server or hard drive crashes.  But, if my house burns down, I&amp;rsquo;m still
out of luck.  Except that I&amp;rsquo;ve also saved those files to my OneDrive account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with saving them to an outside vendor, whether it be Dropbox, Box, or
OneDrive, is that those companies might, at any given moment, decide to simply
disappear from the face of the Earth, taking my important files with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternately, they may sell out to another company that doesn&amp;rsquo;t take the same
precautions, or that decides to hold my data hostagse.  Not an enticing scenario
and, hopefully, an unlikely one. But, taking that risk is &amp;hellip;, well, a risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storage----the-defining-factor&#34;&gt;Storage &amp;ndash; The Defining Factor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest draw for using a service like Nextcloud is available
storage. Unlike the online providers, all of which limit storage, storage for
your self-hosted Nextcloud account is limited only by the available storage on
the server in your home.  Need More? Add another drive, or upgrade to a larger
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, my free OneDrive account is limited to
5 GB of storage.  Dropbox is currently limited to 2GB and will cost you $100 for
a 1TB option. Box offers 10 GB storage with their free plan and $120 a year for
a 100GB plan.  Oh, and all these have upload caps, so if you&amp;rsquo;re uploading big
files, you might be out of luck.  As I mentioned earlier, I have Office365
account that provides my Exchange services, as well as 1TB storage.  I&amp;rsquo;m
probably good there (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if there are upload limits, though I&amp;rsquo;m
sure there are!) But, I&amp;rsquo;ve have that account for about 6 years, during which
time I&amp;rsquo;ve watched the provided services change and generally decline.  I would
not be surprised if, on my next renewal, the amount of available (paid) storage
diminishes. And, that is the risk with all of these services, particularly the
free services: At any time the provide can choose to lower their limits and
suddenly you&amp;rsquo;re locked out of your data, or required to pony up cash to keep the
account usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is not really an issue for me. Part of the reason is because I do
have that
1TB of
paid-for storage, but more importantly because I have several TB of storage on
my local server, without upload limits, and have easy access through my VPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-where-am-i-truly-at&#34;&gt;So, Where Am I Truly At?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For right now, I&amp;rsquo;m leaving the Nextcloud and OnlyOffice servers running.&lt;br&gt;
Whether I will use them is a question that only time will answer.  I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued
by the ability to do on-line editing much as Office Online and Google Docs can
do.  In fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t really see any differences between the various online
editing services based on my general use cases.  I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to play with them
to see whether they meet any specific need that I might have not yet identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wind down my dissertation work my needs for high-powered writing tools
diminishes, as does my need for document storage. In that light, Nextcloud may
provide all the services I need for daily work.  Time will tell that tale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Connecting the MacBook to the Edgerouter VPN</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/connecting-the-macbook-to-the-edgerouter-vpn/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;connecting-the-macbook-to-the-edgerouter-vpn&#34;&gt;Connecting the MacBook to the Edgerouter VPN&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I fixed a problem that has vexed me for some time.  Reading through the
search pages, it seems it has vexed quite a few others, as well.  I thought I&amp;rsquo;d
share my solution to this problem so that others might benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the problem?  I&amp;rsquo;ve setup a VPN server on my Ubiquiti Edgerouter-X. The
VPN works great with my Windows clients, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not been able to get my
MacBook or iPhone to connect. Until today.  The problem turned out to be quite
simple, though it took a bit of reading to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the problem?  I&amp;rsquo;ve setup a VPN server on my Ubiquiti Edgerouter-X. The
VPN works great with my Windows clients, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not been able to get my
MacBook or iPhone to connect. Until today.  The problem turned out to be quite
simple, though it took a bit of reading to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of articles and posts on the discussion boards about similar
problem and a multitude of solutions have been proposed. I turned on logging for
the firewall that provided exactly zero useful information I did a tcpdump
watching ports 500, 1701, and 4500 while I tried to connect. Lots of data, but
nothing useful.  Finally, I ran across a single post &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t remember on what
board &amp;ndash; that provided the solution.  The
only one
that
worked, though has been this one.  I make no promises that it will work for you,
but it is certainly worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;rsquo;s the solution?  When you&amp;rsquo;re setting up your VPN you need to open three
ports: 500, 1701, and 4500.  Take a look at the NAT tab in the Firewall settings
of your GUI.  Is there an entry that points to a destination of 4500?  If so,
delete it.  It seems that some UPNP process hijacks port 4500, which is needed
to the MacBook to connect.  Deleting that entry frees up the port and allows the
VPN connection to complete.  Everything has been working just fine since I
deleted that pesky entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word of caution: Be sure that the UPNP entry isn&amp;rsquo;t required by some process
that you want to use.  In my case, the rule pointed to a destination in a
192.168.x.x network.  I don&amp;rsquo;t use that network. My network is a 10.x.x.x.  I
knew that I could safely delete that entry.  Before deleting yours, double check
what it might be serving.  So far as I know, you can&amp;rsquo;t change the ports for the
VPN, the client determines that.  But, you might be able to change the port on
the UPNP device, if you need to free up port 4500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YMMV; good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;making-progress--slowly&#34;&gt;Making Progress &amp;hellip; Slowly&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot going on the last few months.  I have been struggling to
get my dissertation done. The biggest obstacle has been locating participants
for a qualitative study.  I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; got responses to my recruiting efforts and
have been able to interview 7 people.  That&amp;rsquo;s not a great response, but is
better than nothing (which is what I had in the past!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and allows me to move
forward.  Did I say I was excited?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Having finally gotten the data collected, themed, coded, and all the other
things you do to qualitative data, I finally sat down to write.  For the past
four and a half
days that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much all I&amp;rsquo;ve done: write.  yes, I have literally been
writing 8 - 10 hours a day for the past nearly 5 days.  And I&amp;rsquo;m not done.  I&amp;rsquo;m
getting close, mind you, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t crossed the finish line.  I hope to do
that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving to a Self-Hosted Bookmarking Service</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;moving-to-a-self-hosted-bookmarking-service&#34;&gt;Moving to a Self-Hosted Bookmarking Service&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a hint that bookmarks are going away.  Services like Delicious that used
to provide great web-based book marking services have closed down.  In their
place are the likes of Instapaper and Pinboard and the like that break stuff
into different types. Instapaper to store sites that you want to read later,
Pinterest for images you like, and so forth.  That doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well for me,
though.  I want everything in one place.  That&amp;rsquo;s also why I decided to try a&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Pinterest for images you like, and so forth.  That doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well for me,
though.  I want everything in one place.  That&amp;rsquo;s also why I decided to try a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;couple of web-based products.  I realized that I had bookmarks scattered over
three different browsers, on three different computers. How confusing can it
get?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-self-hosted&#34;&gt;Why Self Hosted?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a variety of services already available on line, why do I want to
self-host? After all, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work to get things set up and to keep
things running correctly.  It would be much simpler to use a series that
already exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary reason is safety.  That is, These services like to shut down without
a lot of notice.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to collect lots of bookmarks only to have the
service shutdown, taking my links with them. I want them to persist.  By hosting
my own, the only risk is that my computer will die.  I back things up for that
reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason is privacy.  It&amp;rsquo;s not so much what I&amp;rsquo;m bookmarking. I don&amp;rsquo;t
really care if you know what I bookmark.  But I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care that you don&amp;rsquo;t try to
market me, or sell my information to someone else who will market me. When using
another service, that risk is real &amp;ndash; they do have to make money.  But, by
hosting my own, I know that can&amp;rsquo;t happen. And, if it does, I get the financial
proceeds :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-services-am-i-using&#34;&gt;What Services Am I Using?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, these services are falling to the wayside, so there aren&amp;rsquo;t a lot of
scripts that are still available and being actively maintained.  I found 3:
SemanticScuttle, Unmark, and Shaarli.  I installed all three so that I could try
them out to see what works for me.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which one I&amp;rsquo;ll settle one. But,
I&amp;rsquo;m already sure which one I won&amp;rsquo;t be using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into any specifics, though, let me give you a little background on
what I prefer. And, where I&amp;rsquo;m likely going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tags&lt;/em&gt; have been around for a while now and I&amp;rsquo;ve rarely used them.  I&amp;rsquo;ll touch
on that in another post.  I&amp;rsquo;m a bit old-fashioned and a little linear in my
thinking.  I like being able to save a bookmark to a specific folder so that I
can quickly find the list of bookmarks related to a specific subject. Yes, I
know tagss allow that, and more and, again, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that in another post.&lt;br&gt;
but bear with me for right now.  I wanted something that would allow me to
import my current bookmarks, maintaining the current structure. None of the
available scripts allowed this (there is one, but it tried to be too many
things, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried it in the past, and its interface is hopelessly outdated).  I
also wanted
to be able to quickly and easily remove duplicates.  And, of course, it had to
be easy to access and use. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at the three
I installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unmark&#34;&gt;Unmark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, none of the three I found supported folders; all supported
tagsging, so I ended up going through and tagsging all my bookmarks.  Unmark held
a lot of promise. I read a lot of good things online about it.  IN practice, I
wasn&amp;rsquo;t impressed. The biggest issue is that Unmark wouldn&amp;rsquo;t import the tagss
associated with the links.  That meant I&amp;rsquo;d need to go through and re-tags all
those links.  That didn&amp;rsquo;t impress me.  Moving forward, of course, it&amp;rsquo;s less an
issue.  But, initially, at least, Unmark failed. I&amp;rsquo;ve also has some issues with
Unmark not loading correctly after signing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;semanticscuttle&#34;&gt;SemanticScuttle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SS imported bookmarks and tagss without issue.  So far, too, it&amp;rsquo;s been easy to
use.  I&amp;rsquo;m still using this one to try to see what it&amp;rsquo;s limits are. So far,
though, I&amp;rsquo;m impressed.  The one drawback is that it depends on a MySQL database.&lt;br&gt;
Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with DBs for years and don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; automatically discount a script
that uses one.  But, I think for my uses, a DB is simply overkill.  It requires
a lot of resource for little added benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shaarli&#34;&gt;Shaarli&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaarli and SS are running neck and neck in the which one does Kevin use race.&lt;br&gt;
From the user perspective, the two are identical.  And, like SS, Shaarli
imported tagss without issue.  Sweet.  The other thing about Shaarli that I like
is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on a database.  It uses a simple XML file to store its
data.  That not only makes backing up the data dead simple, it also means
minimal resources.  I could literally copy the files to a new computer and just
keep going. That is an awesome feature.  Shaarli also allows you tom make short
notes, or even use it as a pastebin kind of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-one-do-i-recommend&#34;&gt;Which One Do I Recommend?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet.  Unlike some folks that spend a day or two playing with a
service and then making a pronouncement about how good (or bad) it is, I want to
work with them a while to see which fits into my work flow best.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Education Relevant?</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-education-relevant&#34;&gt;Is Education Relevant&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the questions with which I have wrestled for a while now is the question of what it means to be ‘educated’.  The problem, of course, is that there is no one definition and that, I think, creates much of the problem in evaluating educational programs.  The state of Georgia recently put on the ballot a bill that would create an “Opportunity School District”. In an effort to address “failing” schools, the state proposed taking them over and doing whatever is necessary to ‘improve’ outcomes.  As I pondered the proposal, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; one of the questions that I continually confronted was what does it mean for school to “fail”? Who determines this? And, on what is it based?  Advertisements for the plan suggested that “only 12% of third graders in our failings schools are reading on grade-level.” That, of course, raised other questions for me.  For example, how does this compare to third graders in those schools that are not considered to be failing? What does it mean to read on grade level?  Recognizing that people learn at different rates and that skills such as reading are commonly dependent on external factors such as how much reading goes on in the home, is the standard even appropriate? These and several other questions brought me back around to the question of what it means to be educated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These and several other questions brought me back around to the question of what it means to be educated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that schools are generally managed at the local level in order to meet the needs of the particular community.  We know, for example, that students in predominantly rural areas have different experiences, values, needs, and interests than students living in urban areas. Those different values, experiences, needs, and interests necessarily create a different set of learning needs.  I currently live in a predominantly rural area where many, if not most, students will grow up to work in agriculture. Their parents are not highly educated and their likely career path does not require a high level of education. Consequently, once the student has mastered the basic of reading, writing, and math they’re probably pretty much ready for their world.  In contrast, the urban child’s parents may be more highly educated and their environment offers more in terms of potential career choices.  Basic skills of reading, writing, and math may not be sufficient to meet their future needs.  Relevance of what is being taught to the career paths most open to them are vastly different. Shouldn’t their educational expectations be different also?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is the Georgia’s proposal reasonable? Or, are we trying to fit everyone into the same box, ignoring differences in community values and needs in order to meet some nebulous (and dare I say suspect) ‘standard’ that has no foundation in fact?  Does it matter whether the child at age 8 can read at a specific level? Or, does it matter more that he is continuing to develop reading skills?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this post doesn’t really get to the topic of being “educated” as the first sentence suggests, but it lays a foundation for future conversations that will address this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you’re reading, bear in mind that I do not put my thoughts here as definitive, but as exploratory.  I am still learning, thinking, and trying to understand. I write here to share that journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-the-challenges-of-jekyll&#34;&gt;Learning the Challenges of Jekyll&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a few days ago I decided to use Jekyll to generate a static website to host
all &amp;ndash; well, most &amp;ndash; of my writing.  Jekyll, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, is a different beast
from most applications used for these purposes.  I&amp;rsquo;ve found several themes that
I really liked, but they all had some sort of quirks that made them less easy to
use.  I&amp;rsquo;m finding, though, that &amp;ldquo;easy to use&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Jekyll&amp;rdquo; probably don&amp;rsquo;t belong
in the same sentence. Each of the themes I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at require slightly
different structures, use categories differently, and just generally appear
rather finicky.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure for people that have played with it for quite a while, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
these quirks are just part of the landscape. For people like me, who haven&amp;rsquo;t
really spent much time with the software, it&amp;rsquo;s a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges that I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered is making links work from the
dynamically created pages..  Say
for
example, I have a a post entitled, &amp;ldquo;Blogging with Jekyll&amp;rdquo;. When I generate the
site, Jekyll automatically creates a link to that post.  BUT, some of the themes
I played with didn&amp;rsquo;t generate the full link. They pointed me to the title, but
had not appended the &amp;lsquo;.html&amp;rsquo; to the page. The result? A blank page.  It took
some Googling around to find out that adding the &amp;lsquo;.html&amp;rsquo; to the end of the
&amp;lsquo;:title&amp;rsquo; part of the permalink fixed the problem.  Simple fix, once I finally
found it, but why was that ever a problem? Why wasn&amp;rsquo;t the &amp;lsquo;.html&amp;rsquo; added by the
theme creator?  Surely his or her copy of the script didn&amp;rsquo;t work without that
extension, either.  Not sure what I mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the _config.yml file I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-permalink:&#34; data-lang=&#34;permalink:&#34;&gt;
What is needed is 
 permalink:           /:title.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;x
Again, simple fix &amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;navigation-problems&#34;&gt;Navigation Problems.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I wanted a theme that included navigation so that anyone reading the
site could move around within it.  One of the themes I really like didn&amp;rsquo;t have
navigation.  I probably could have added it but, frankly, didn&amp;rsquo;t want to take
the time to figure it out.  So, I settled for one that included navigation.&lt;br&gt;
Except that the navigation didn&amp;rsquo;t work correctly.  I&amp;rsquo;m not working from my
webserver root, so a baseurl is needed.  The navigation (home, back, and next
buttons) didn&amp;rsquo;t account for a non-root structure.  So, after a bit of plugging
about I finally found the template that contains thenavigation links (they&amp;rsquo;re
not
always in the same
place from one theme to another). Search about until I found the right variables
to include.  Now, I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% raw %}{{ site.baseurl }}\{{ page.previous.url }} {% endraw %}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works correctly.  I had to do this for the home button, as well as the
previous and next buttons.  And, I&amp;rsquo;m sure as I continue to work with the site,
I&amp;rsquo;ll find other things like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands right now, I&amp;rsquo;ll use this theme.  As I work more with the scripts,
I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to understand them a little better.  But I&amp;rsquo;d much rather spend my
time writing than trying to fix the platform that I&amp;rsquo;m using to host that
writing.  Yes, Wordpress or some such would have been easier, but, as I said in
&lt;a href=&#34;../blogging-with-jekyll&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; I
really
do think that a database driven website is overkill for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title> Getting Started with Ham Radio</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;getting-started-with-ham-radio&#34;&gt;Getting Started with Ham Radio&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the goals on my bucket list has been getting my Ham radio license.  I
don&amp;rsquo;t remember, really, when it first landed on my list.  I was a teen and it
most likely was the result of some movie I saw or book I read that extolled the
use and excitement of reaching out to the world through radio. The desire wasn&amp;rsquo;t
helped, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, by having an uncle that got into it after he retired.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

don&amp;rsquo;t remember, really, when it first landed on my list.  I was a teen and it

helped, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, by having an uncle that got into it after he retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Times have changed, of course, and where once amateur radio was the only  means
for
contacting the world beyond my community, the internet has made huge inroads in
that domain.  In fact, one does have to ask why get a license? As I began to
ponder that question I began to realize that it is less for the excitement and
mystique of reaching out to others far away and more about simple
accomplishment.  Earning a license requires that I gain the necessary knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
After all, if it was only about communicating with others, I could do that with
the
internet or family radios (FRS) or, if I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to have a license, a General
Mobile Radio Service license.  No knowledge required.  But it&amp;rsquo;s about learning
the basics of electronics, of radio waves, and the rules that govern their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about lately is the range of knowledge that
we all carry around that we don&amp;rsquo;t really recognize or appreciate.  As it turns
out, as I started to study for the exam I began to realize how much knowledge I
already had in this domain.  I already understand the basics of electronic
circuits, for example, In fact, I took a couple of practice tests and the only
real areas I failed were those related to the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to get started on this bucket list item.  I may never actually do
much with the license, but going through that process is important for me to
meet a bucket list goal and to have the option to use amateur radio when, and
if, I choose to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And options are always good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weewx on the Raspberry PI</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/weewx-on-the-raspberry-pi/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;weewx-on-the-raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;Weewx on the Raspberry Pi&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved gadgets.  When the first Raspberry Pis came out a few years ago, I was pretty confident that eventually, I&amp;rsquo;d get one.  About three years ago I decided I wanted to build a media server and the RPI seemed the perfect tool for the job.  While it works, it didn&amp;rsquo;t do all that I had hoped.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the device&amp;rsquo;s fault; the software just didn&amp;rsquo;t quite match up with my particular use case.  So, the device sat idle for a while.  5}&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;weewx-on-the-raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;Weewx on the Raspberry Pi&lt;/h1&gt;

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the device&amp;rsquo;s fault; the software just didn&amp;rsquo;t quite match up with my particular use case.  So, the device sat idle for a while.  5}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, though, another use came along in the form of a VPN server for my internal network. For this I used the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://softether.org&#34;&gt;SoftEther VPN&lt;/a&gt; software.  If you have need for a VPN server to access your internal network, I strongly recommend this software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, though, other uses for the little device began to emerge.  One
such use is to provide some of the weather data that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t provide via my
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meteobridge.com/wiki/index.php/Home&#34;&gt;Meteobridge&lt;/a&gt; device as I
outlined in &lt;a href=&#34;../changes-in-my-weather-station&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Meteobridge device could provide almost all of the data I needed to serve the weather website, it cannot generate NOAA-type files in order to feed some of the scripts I run on my website. So, I started looking for alternatives.   In keeping with my motivation for moving to the Meteobridge, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to run a Windows machine. Rather,  I wanted another small, low-power device.  the RPI came to mind.  After doing some digging around I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://weewx.com&#34;&gt;weewx&lt;/a&gt;, an opensource software that did exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, the RPI running weewx can do everything that the Meteobridge can do
and a whole lot more.  Had I started a bit earlier, I might have chosen to use
only weewx rather than Meteobridge. I believe that the Meoteobridge license
comes up for renewall in a year or so.  I may chose to drop it in favor of
Weewx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing holdimg me back, though, will be the really nice imaging that
Meteobridge provides for webcams.  I do have a webcam that I include on my
website.  Having that really nice, clean banner across the bottom of the image
makes for a very nice looking presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll have to ponder that one a while!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Life Long Learning</title>

&lt;p&gt;One of the &amp;lsquo;goals&amp;rsquo; of the nursing department is that we develop &amp;rsquo;life long
learners&amp;rsquo;.  What this means, I suppose is up for some debate but I think,
generally, that what is meant is that we prepare our students to learn how to
identify their professional learning needs and help them develop the skills
needed to meet those on-going needs.  After all, health care is an ever-evolving
field and constant learning is required. As I have pointed out to my students
for many years, many of the diseases that we deal with today were not identified&lt;/p&gt;</description>

learners&amp;rsquo;.  What this means, I suppose is up for some debate but I think,
generally, that what is meant is that we prepare our students to learn how to
identify their professional learning needs and help them develop the skills
needed to meet those on-going needs.  After all, health care is an ever-evolving
field and constant learning is required. As I have pointed out to my students
for many years, many of the diseases that we deal with today were not identified&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when I was in school. Nor were many of the procedures that are routinely
conducted today.  So, if the professional is to remain a professional he or she
is required to constantly learn new information about those diseases,
procedures, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To aim to prepare our students to continue to learn is, clearly, an important
goal.  But, as I think about it, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that it&amp;rsquo;s the right goal.  I was
watching a TED talk by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ted.com/talks/ben_dunlap_talks_about_a_passionate_life&#34;&gt;Dr. Bernie Dunlap&lt;/a&gt;
the president of Wofford College in South Carolina, a few days ago and after a 20 minute talk on the influence of
various Hungarians on his life, he got to the real point of his talk.  He was
chronicling the interaction over dinner at his home between Dr. Francis
Robicsek, a cardiovascular surgeon and collector of french art and Mayan art and
Roger Milliken, CEO of Milliken &amp;amp; Company about, of all things, a Harry Potter
movie.  The crux of the story was that the two were arguing over whether the
second Harry Potter movie was as good as the first.  That these two titans
should be discussing, much less arguing, over such a mundane thing seems
unfathomable.  In his winning stroke, Dr. Robiscek said, &amp;ldquo;I bet you went to the
movie with a child&amp;rdquo; to which Milliken replied that he did.  Robiscek closes in
for the kill: &amp;ldquo;Ah-hah!  I went all by myself!&amp;rdquo;  In that moment, says Dunlap he
realized the essence of life-long learning.  It was, he says, that &amp;ldquo;insatiable
curiosity, that irrepressible desire to know, no matter what the subject, no
matter what the cost&amp;rdquo; that represents life long learning.  It isn&amp;rsquo;t simply
learning that which one needs to know to remain current in one&amp;rsquo;s field but the
desire to know more about more things.  To understand in greater depth the
totality of human knowing and experience that defines life-long learning. And
this, I fear, we do not do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sirkenrobinson.com/&#34;&gt;Sir Ken Robinson&lt;/a&gt; speaks and writes often of the
negative impact that our
educational system has on creativity.  I see his point, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t fully
agree with it.  But I think, just as importantly &amp;ndash; and perhaps more importantly
&amp;ndash; our educational system negatively impacts our desire to learn.  By insisting
on specific performance standards, grading work against some (nominally)
objective standard, and a host of other oppressive measures, education has
worked against itself by inadvertently discouraging curiosity and exploration in
favor of
conformity and blind acceptance.  Students are provided little incentive and
virtually no support in thinking outside the box or of exploring things that are
of interest to them but, at least in the minds of others, of little direct
value.  But value is in the eye of the beholder.  Many see a liberal arts
education as having little value because such an education does not lead
directly to a job.  But, the liberal arts graduate has a broader, and deeper,
overall skill set than the &amp;lsquo;vocationally&amp;rsquo; trained student.  That broad education
equips them with the skills to adapt to a constantly changing environment in
ways that the B-school trained student may not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning requires challenging one&amp;rsquo;s self.  It requires stretching beyond what is
known and comfortable. It requires exploring ideas, even the bad ones, to find
out what makes them bad and to ferret out any good that might lie hidden within
them. Learning requires taking risks to define our limits and to know what lies
beyond what we believe we know.  It requires considering things that are not
within our ken or belief system to understand how others believe as they do and
how the two can be reconciled.  Learning requires freedom not restrictions.&lt;br&gt;
Yet, my wife was telling me last night that a local elementary school limits
students to reading books only with their tested Lexile range.  How ridiculous!&lt;br&gt;
Yes, they will find the reading perhaps easier, but how do they extend their
reading range, expand their vocabularies, and extend their understanding of the
world if they&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to stretch themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changes in my Weather Station</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;changes-in-my-weather-station&#34;&gt;Changes in my Weather Station&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 8 years I&amp;rsquo;ve managed a personal weather station consisting of a
Davis Vantagse Pro and a Windows computer running the excellent Weather Display
software.  Last December I decided that the inexpensive computer I was running
the scripts on may well be coming to its end-of-life and went looking for
alternatives. Another goal of this move was to lower my cost of operations.  The
Jetway computer I was running didn&amp;rsquo;t use a lot of power, perhaps 25 W, but if I
could do better, I would. After all, at 25 watts, that&amp;rsquo;s about 219 kW or $26.25
annually.  With the growth of small computers such as the Raspberry Pi, I knew I
could do better. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Jetway computer I was running didn&amp;rsquo;t use a lot of power, perhaps 25 W, but if I

annually.  With the growth of small computers such as the Raspberry Pi, I knew I
could do better. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some mucking around, I found Meteobridge.  Meteobridge is software that
gets flashed onto a TP-Link TL-3060Mr (and some other similar devices).  While
not nearly as full-featured as Weather Display,  the Meteobridge software works
well and sends the data to my website without problems.  Best of all, the total
price was about $100 and will use about 0.6 W, that&amp;rsquo;s about 5.256 kW or a
whopping 63 cents per year!  The whole shebang will pay for it self in about 3.5
years.  Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Meteobridge has a couple of caveats.  One is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t store data,
so a separate device is needed for that (it does have the ability to save to a
mysql database hosted elsewhere). Nor does it generate the NOAA style reports
that are needed for some of the calculations and webpages that I generate (for
example, the freeze data &amp;ndash; first and last freeze dates for the year, number of
days below freezing, etc). Another caveat is that the updates are available only
for two years, then you have to buy an update license.  Having not had to do
that yet, I don&amp;rsquo;t know the cost.  Perhaps another caveat is that the product is
dependent on the Meteobridge server.  The OS is not actually stored on the
device but is downloaded each time the server reboots. Now, my server has run
for as many as 133 days without a hiccup, so that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen often. But it
could.  This can be mitigated by including a USB stick on the device so that the
data are saved, together with a copy of software for those eventualities when
the MB server isn&amp;rsquo;t available. Good to know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for now, I&amp;rsquo;m sticking with the Meteobridge.  Overall, I like it and have
found workarounds to the issues that have cropped up.  One of those is the
Raspberry Pi and weewx.  I&amp;rsquo;ll deal with that in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blogging with Jekyll</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/blogging-with-jekyll/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;blogging-with-jekyll&#34;&gt;Blogging with Jekyll&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past nearly 10 years I&amp;rsquo;ve tried numerous times to maintain a
blog.  I enjoy writing and figured it would be a good way not only to practice
the skill, but to share my thoughts with others.  I don&amp;rsquo;t really care whether
anyone reads my work, to be honest; I just want to write. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that, while I don&amp;rsquo;t care so much if I&amp;rsquo;m read, I do want
to be able to keep my files and refer back to them from time to time &amp;ndash;
something
of a journal (which is what the blog was originally conceived to be). That means
that I need the writing in form that is easily saved and retrieved. Another
concern has been that I be able to write from essentially any computer, any
where.  I started, as most folks do, on Blogger, then moved to Wordpress, each
time abandoning my work and the platform, as I moved to another. That&amp;rsquo;s not what
I intended.  Making the process more difficult is that the writing is stored in
a database. This makes retrieval of the raw data difficult, particularly if
you&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten the password, or the database is corrupt, etc.  And, to be
honest, those platforms are simply more complex than my needs. What I needed was
a simple, easy to use platform that allowed me to maintain a file of my work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;flat-files&#34;&gt;Flat files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or so ago I became aware of flat-file blogging systems such as
Grav, HTMLy, Pico, and the like.  These were awesome!  They allowed me to write
my entries in plain text or Markup, upload the file to my server and, Viola!  I
had a blog.  These were awesome &amp;ndash; and still are. On the whole, these systems
meet my needs but, being the curious soul that I am, I wondered if there were
other ways.  Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if my setup didn&amp;rsquo;t depend on which PHP version
I was running?  Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if the system didn&amp;rsquo;t break every time
something changed on the back end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amazon-web-services&#34;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I started playing around with Amazon Web
Service (AWS)
S3 storage.  One of the things you can do with S3 is serve static websites.&lt;br&gt;
Cool.  the kicker is, of course, that the site must be static.  Static websites
have some advantagses.  First, any webserver can serve html files, no special
resources or support files needed.  HTML is the reason webservers exist and was
the standard for early websites. Another advantagse is that a static site is not
subject to server-side scripting issues. This means that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter
whether you have the right version of PHP or PERL installed; the site will
simply work.  A third advantagse is that if you ever decide to move your site,
you simply copy the files to another server and you&amp;rsquo;re in business, no fiddling
needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test out the AWS webserver with S3 I started with the website
automatically created by Weewx, a linux based weather software to serve data
from my local personal weather station.  I uploaded the files and, lo and
behold, it worked like a charm!  There was just one problem: To keep the weather
information current, I needed to upload the files every 5 minutes.  This
identified one of the problems with static websites &amp;ndash; all files get uploaded
every time.  I was uploading somewhere around 85 files every 5 minutes.  In a 24
hour period that was about 24,500 files. Each file is a PUT, in AWS terminology,
so I was uploading a boatload of files every day.  S3 allows up to 2,000 puts
per day and charges $ 0.005 per 1000 files after that.  It would end up
costing
me 12 cents a day to maintain that site.  That&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable &amp;ndash; less than
$4 a month. But not necessarily cheap either.  I can buy full support web servers
for about that price and not worry about upload, storage, DNS (AWS charges for
DNS services, too), or bandwidth costs. But, there are other uses that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
cost as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such use is the blog. Now, Grav, Pico, and such, all require PHP,
which is not available in S3.  So, to do a blog on S3, I needed a static site
generator that would create the site locally, then upload them generated files
to the server.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.staticgen.com&#34;&gt;StaticGen&lt;/a&gt; is a great site that
lists dozens of static site generators, together with basic information about
them and their relative popularity.  Jekyll is, by far, the most popular. Also
pretty popular is Hugo.  I&amp;rsquo;ve played with and like both.  Unlike Jekyll, which is
written in Ruby, and interpreted language, Hugo is written in Go, which is
compiled.  This means, generally, Hugo should be faster for rendering larger
sites.  I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to their speed, given the small number of pages I&amp;rsquo;ve
created so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trying-them-out&#34;&gt;Trying Them Out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just from early use, I generally like Hugo better.  I can&amp;rsquo;t put my
finger on why, though.  Initially, I found Jekyll a bit confusing to use.  While
the documentation is extensive, it is not terribly user friendly in my view.&lt;br&gt;
Even while I&amp;rsquo;m actually fairly conversant in computerese, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that the
documentation got to the point in providing a new user with the resources needed
to really get started.  That&amp;rsquo;s one place where, I think, Hugo was better.  So,
why did I end up using Jekyll?  Mostly because of themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a dozen or so themes on Hugo.  Some worked; most didn&amp;rsquo;t.  I&amp;rsquo;m
sure it had much to do with user error, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend the time to
troubleshoot.  The themes I tried in Jekyll just worked.  So, I went with
Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-plan&#34;&gt;My Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan is try Jekyll for a while and, if I do end up changing, it
shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be be that big of a deal.  I suspect, though I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested it, that
the files should be easily converted between the two; they both use Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Designing your Life</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/designing-your-life/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;designing-your-life&#34;&gt;Designing Your Life&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &amp;lsquo;attended&amp;rsquo; a presentation by Story Musgrave, the astronaut, on &amp;ldquo;Designing your
life&amp;rdquo; or some such similar topic.  While I wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly impressed with his
general rambling presentation style, I was very impressed with the message that
threaded throughout his story. I took several keys away from the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-value-of-curiosity&#34;&gt;The value of curiosity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first takeaway was the importance of curiosity in achieving an effective
life. From high school drop out, he went on to earn a BS in math and statistics,
MBA in operations analysis and computer programming, BA in chemistry, MD, and MS
in physiology and biophysics within an 8 year period.  He would later earn an MA
in literature.  To me, the broad range of areas, as much as the time frame for
these accomplishments, says a great deal. He explored the areas that interested
him. He committed himself to those areas. Most students today would be
counseled to choose a singular path and follow it. Yet, the life he built for
himself was one based on the intersections of his interests.  Each area of
interest exposed him to ideas that he wanted to explore further and so he did.&lt;br&gt;
By not limiting himself to a given field, he opened up new avenues for self
expression and provided himself the skills to create new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

By not limiting himself to a given field, he opened up new avenues for self
expression and provided himself the skills to create new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seizing-opportunity&#34;&gt;Seizing opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second takeaway&lt;/strong&gt; was the importance of seizing opportunity.  When
opportunities presented themselves he took advantagse of them.  He leveraged
those opportunities into even more opportunities.  He also, and this is
important, created opportunity by highlighting the skills and knowledge that he
brought to the table.  He didn&amp;rsquo;t play the game.  He was forthright in what he
had accomplished and what he could do.  He recognized that opportunities may
have long-term payoffs when, for example, he chose to work for free in a
neuroscience lab in order to gain the experience and knowledge he wanted from
that field.  His earlier skills played a vital role in his success in that
field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;take-risks&#34;&gt;Take risks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third takeaway, I think, was his willingness to take risks.  He did this in
many ways, but the one that stood out to me was his use of a one page resume
that played up his accomplishments and his skills rather than his
&amp;lsquo;qualifications&amp;rsquo;.  That is he highlighted what he had accomplished and his
qualities rather than his pedigree.  This is a truly important concept for the
liberal arts major.  Highlighting what you&amp;rsquo;re capable of, rather than simply
listing academic credentials makes the difference. His one page resume showed
his academic credentials, but also highlighted what he had done with those
credentials, as well as the non-academic accomplishments he had that further
attested to his capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;everything-is-connected&#34;&gt;Everything is connected&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth takeaway was the importance of recognizing how the fields intersect.&lt;br&gt;
No field operates in isolation.  By intersecting his various degrees and
experiences he was able to build a remarkable life of accomplishment and was
able to create new knowledge, new science.  I would not particularly care to
suffer through his presentation again, but would love to see the major points he
wanted to make so that I could consider them further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if he has a book &amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Thoughts on Philosophy</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/some-thoughts-on-philosophy/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/some-thoughts-on-philosophy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-thoughts-on-philosophy&#34;&gt;Some Thoughts on Philosophy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;ll begin this treatise with a question:  What is philosophy?  And perhaps another, just to follow on that, why is philosophy important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take things in order, my simple answer to the question of what is philosophy is to say that it is, generally, the creed by which one lives one&amp;rsquo;s life. I think the dominance of big names in the field &amp;ndash; Nietzsche, Hume, Watts Marx, and so many others &amp;ndash; and the deep, convoluted and difficult writings that these big&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; names have produced have left most people with the impression that philosophy requires deep, almost mystical thought on very esoteric subjects.  And, from my readings, I think there&amp;rsquo;s sufficient evidence that this impression is not wholly inaccurate. But, the depths of thought that the writings of these great names reveal are, I believe, the exceptions rather than the rule of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-thoughts-on-philosophy&#34;&gt;Some Thoughts on Philosophy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;ll begin this treatise with a question:  What is philosophy?  And perhaps another, just to follow on that, why is philosophy important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take things in order, my simple answer to the question of what is philosophy is to say that it is, generally, the creed by which one lives one&amp;rsquo;s life. I think the dominance of big names in the field &amp;ndash; Nietzsche, Hume, Watts Marx, and so many others &amp;ndash; and the deep, convoluted and difficult writings that these big&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; names have produced have left most people with the impression that philosophy requires deep, almost mystical thought on very esoteric subjects.  And, from my readings, I think there&amp;rsquo;s sufficient evidence that this impression is not wholly inaccurate. But, the depths of thought that the writings of these great names reveal are, I believe, the exceptions rather than the rule of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophy itself can be seen from several perspectives. These perspectives include ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and logic.  Each of these four areas explore the world in different, but complementary, ways.  Before I get bogged down in the specifics of these four areas (I won&amp;rsquo;t go too deeply, so no need to fret), I want to back up and make one thing abundantly clear: In the final analysis, philosophy is the way that each of us makes sense of our world and defines how we conduct our lives.  In that sense, each of us possesses a philosophy &amp;ndash; or more accurately, a set of philosophies &amp;ndash; on which we rely as we live our lives. Collectively, these collections of philosophies might be called our &amp;ldquo;worldview&amp;rdquo;.  That is, how we see and interpret the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I move on to talk about the notion that we each have a unique philosophy that guides our lives, I want to briefly introduce the four major areas in which philosophy concerns itself. I have chosen to arrange them from what I believe to be the most basic, concrete form to the more esoteric. Entire books are written on each of these topics, so this discussion is, by necessity, very limited. Be mindful, too, that I am not a philosopher, so these definitions are my own interpretations and should not be considered definitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-very-brief-primer-on-philosophy&#34;&gt;A (Very) Brief Primer on Philosophy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first form is &lt;strong&gt;ethics&lt;/strong&gt;.  In a nutshell, ethics considers good and bad. That is, it asks us to define the things that we ought to do (and ought not do), as well as to consider what is &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; in any situation.  Ethics involves questions of morality.  So, in a large sense, ethics defines our values in terms of how we treat others and how we should act, even when others are not looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in healthcare, as I have done for many years, I&amp;rsquo;ve had many opportunities to examine ethical issues. That is, issues for which there is no clear answer.  For example, when should you &amp;lsquo;pull the plug&amp;rsquo; on someone whose likelihood of survival is unlikely (or &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; you pull the plug?).  How should an error that violates someone&amp;rsquo;s religious dietary laws be handled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding our ethical view of life helps us to gain consistency in our actions and words. This, in turn, helps to minimize internal conflict between what we believe to be right and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second form is  &lt;strong&gt;logic&lt;/strong&gt;.  Logic has to do with how we think things through, how we use reason to arrive at some conclusion.  Given the avalanche of data and information that comes our way in a given day, the ability to sort out fact from fiction is vitally important if we are to make any type of valid decision.  But that is far more easily said than done.  Wikipedia defines logic as &amp;ldquo;the systematic study of the forms of inference, the relations that lead to the acceptance of one proposition, the conclusion, on the basis of a set of other propositions, the premises&amp;rdquo;. That is, logic gives us a way of systematically analyzing incoming information, setting it in relationship to information we may already have, in order to determine the validity of the new information. In doing so, we are able &amp;ndash; hopefully &amp;ndash; to draw a valid conclusion regarding the topic at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critical Thinking&lt;/em&gt;, a topic of much interest to me, relies heavily on logic to sort out fact from fiction and to provide a means for evaluating the truth that underlies the information I encounter as I go through life. Critical thinking also requires a healthy infusion of epistemic philosophy, our third form, to answer the questions we face in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epistemology&lt;/strong&gt; is concerned with knowledge &amp;ndash; what we know, and how we know it. This form moves into an even more esoteric sort of thinking by asking us to consider what constitutes knowledge, how we justify what we claim to be knowledge, and so on.  You&amp;rsquo;ve heard, and probably used, a number of terms related to epistemology without knowing that you were talking about epistemology.  &lt;em&gt;Empiricism&lt;/em&gt;, for example, refers to the knowledge we gain from experience.  Experience being primarily rooted in our senses of taste, touch, smell, hearing, and seeing. It is &amp;ldquo;seeing it with my own eyes&amp;rdquo; to justify belief in the truth of some assertion. &lt;em&gt;Rational&lt;/em&gt; thought, on the other hand, discounts experience in favor of reason to justify knowledge. Are you a &lt;em&gt;pragmatist&lt;/em&gt;?  If so, then you value knowledge as it relates to its practical applications in the world.   All of these views &amp;ndash; and there are others &amp;ndash; describe ways in which epistemology influences what we &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final form is that of &lt;strong&gt;metaphysics&lt;/strong&gt;. Metaphysics is concerned with the nature of reality.  It asks what exists in the world, and how the world is ordered.  I suspect for most people, it is metaphysics that they think of when thinking of philosophy for it is metaphysics that is most concerned with questions such as &amp;ldquo;is there a God?&amp;rdquo; Or, what is truth?.  What does it mean to be alive? And all such other truly esoteric questions for which there are no answers.
###Great!  Why Does This Matter to Me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as I said earlier, we all hold a set of philosophies that define our view of the world and the lanes in which we live our lives.  If you read these great philosophers, you&amp;rsquo;ll come away with the notion that philosophy is some grand view that unifies all of the elements of life. Not so.  Most people, I think, operate from a variety of philosophies that speak to the various areas of life. For example, I am a teacher and, as such, have a philosophy that defines how I see teaching and learning. That philosophy provides the foundation for how I approach the process of educating others.  That philosophy is actually composed of several other ideas &amp;ndash; what it means to learn, how people learn, what it means to educate or to be educated (both as a adjective and as a verb), and so on.  I am also a nurse, and in that role, hold a different set of philosophies about what it means to be a nurse, to care for others, to encourage healing and so on.  Politics, religion, economics, and many other fields are also philosophical domains in which I have developed ideas and approaches that help to define my world and guide my actions. In all likelihood, you reading this have also developed sets of philosophies in each of these regards, though you may not have explicitly stated them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have come be see the value in spending a bit of time exploring my philosophies, not so that I can pontificate, but so that I can see more clearly the values that underly my actions and decisions.  I won&amp;rsquo;t share my philosophies here, mostly because they&amp;rsquo;re unique to me and likely of little interest to anyone else, though bits and pieces of them surface periodically as I write. Still, I find it important to write down my philosophies. And I encourage you to do the same.  Why?  Because doing so forces you to think about and examine your thoughts &amp;ndash; what you believe.  Even though each of us carries our load of philosophies around, seldom are we cognizant of them. By taking the time to think about them, examine them, write them down, we are forced to acknowledge them and the (frequent) contradictions that they represent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our philosophies, whether they be explicit or implicit, form the lens through which we see the world around us.  This, in turn, helps us to better understand how our view of the world differs from how others view the world and allows us to recognize that these other folks are not &amp;lsquo;wrong&amp;rsquo; in their view, they&amp;rsquo;re just seeing the world from a different point of view. In a very simple example, remember those 3-D glasses from years past? You know, the ones with one green lens and one red one. If you look at the image through just the red lens the world takes on a red hue and some things are simply not visible.  Look through the green lens and the world takes on a green hue and some things that were visible have disappeared and new ones have appeared.  But, look through both at the same time and the image looks &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; and all the things you saw before have returned with greater depth of image.  If all we ever knew was the view through the red lens, our view of the world would be missing information. It would be incomplete.  Others, looking only through the green lens, would be missing different information.  By being aware that we&amp;rsquo;re each looking at the world through a different lens and that our lens may prevent us from seeing some things, we are able to recognize that it is the combined view of everyone &amp;ndash; red lenses and green lenses &amp;ndash; that give the most complete view of &amp;lsquo;reality&amp;rsquo; (whatever that is!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point? Well, there are two: First, we need to be aware of our lenses .. that we are seeing only some parts of the world, not the whole thing. Second, that only by taking into consideration all points of view &amp;ndash; all lenses &amp;ndash; are we able to get a reasonably reliable view of the world as it truly is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Social Filters Impact an Educated Response</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-social-filters-impact-an-educated-response&#34;&gt;How Social Filters Impact an Educated Response&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hallmarks of the well-educated person is, I think, the ability and willingness to explore all sides of an issue before making a decision. Unfortunately, it seems that few people, even those who are, in fact, well-educated, truly take the time to explore an issue before taking a stance on it. And, to a large extent, I get it. It’s hard to do.  It’s hard, not only because it takes time and effort, but because we are bombarded by so much information from so many different sources and on so many different topics that it is difficult to winnow out the wheat from the chaff.  What is important? What should I be concerned with?  What issues can I reasonably relegate to secondary or tertiary concern and on which should I focus my attention? &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What is important? What should I be concerned with?  What issues can I reasonably relegate to secondary or tertiary concern and on which should I focus my attention? &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two truly modern factors make it even more difficult to view the world through an educated lens.  First, there is a great deal of fake news out there.  Recent news articles have focused on this phenomenon 1,2.  Some sites, such as Onion.com are deliberately fake in an effort to satirize current events.  This is to be expected and is, in its own way, a means for highlighting problems in news reporting, as well as in the systems (such as the political system) it targets.  More concerning, however, are those sites that pose as legitimate news sources while promulgating false information as “news”.  Both Facebook and Google have fallen prey to this type of ‘reporting’ and it doesn’t help that sites like Yahoo.com intersperse advertisements disguised as news articles within the listings of legitimate news.  Figuring out whether news is truly valid is becoming harder and harder to do.  And, as the difficulty rises, the willingness to expend the energy to figure out what is valid declines.  The result? People make decisions based on questionable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second factor is equally concerning.  As people rely increasingly on the internet and social media for their news, the algorithms used on those sites provides a lopsided view of the world 3. We all know that Amazon, Google, and a host of other sites tailor ads to meet your interests.  Those same algorithms are used to to tailor the news you see.  As El-Bermawy notes in his &lt;em&gt;wired&lt;/em&gt; opinion piece, the result of this tailored news is that you are only reading news that conforms to your interests.  Thus, if you’re against some issue (abortion, for example) you’ll only see news that reflects that perspective.  On the one hand, that seems reasonable.  Certainly, if I am interested in solar power having my news filtered to show me articles on that topic is quite useful. On the other hand, if I’m interested in some controversial topic the filters help to ensure that I only see articles that support my view.  That’s not so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a democratic society in which the people have a substantial say in the shaping of policy it is important that the people have a good understanding of the issues.  This means that they need to understand both the pros and the cons.  Filtered news, as El-Barmawy notes, creates a situation in which the reader isn’t given the opportunity to learn about the varying perspectives; they only get their own perspective reinforced.  In effect, there is a confirmation bias in the news they receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most concerning of all is that most people will not realize that they’re not being given the whole news.  It isn’t obvious that their news has been filtered to fit their perspectives. It wasn’t a choice they made consciously but is the result of algorithms reacting to their prior activities.  The result is that their store of knowledge — and their understanding of the issues — is trapped in a silo that protects them from alternative views.  And exactly those alternative views are essential to a complete understanding of an issue and an appropriate decision regarding those issues in a democratic society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

      <title>The First Thing Every College Should Do For Its Students</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-first-thing-every-college-should-do-for-its-students&#34;&gt;The First Thing Every College Should Do For Its Students&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time now I’ve argued that colleges and universities have dropped the ball on one of the most important preparatory steps in attending college: Defining what a college education is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students often go to college without a clear conception of what they’re supposed to be getting from the experience.  They go because college has become the “thing you do” after high school.  Like their secondary education, they never really stop to think about why they’re going, or what the benefits are. More importantly, many students see college as simply an extension of their secondary education. That is, learning without an express purpose other than “I’ll need to know this someday.” &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-first-thing-every-college-should-do-for-its-students&#34;&gt;The First Thing Every College Should Do For Its Students&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time now I’ve argued that colleges and universities have dropped the ball on one of the most important preparatory steps in attending college: Defining what a college education is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students often go to college without a clear conception of what they’re supposed to be getting from the experience.  They go because college has become the “thing you do” after high school.  Like their secondary education, they never really stop to think about why they’re going, or what the benefits are.

That is, learning without an express purpose other than “I’ll need to know this someday.” &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The costs of a college education continue to rise and students, rightfully, should be informed of their options for an education, for educational financing, and even for their careers.  Yet, most colleges don’t do anything to provide the incoming student with an overview of what a college education can do for them and what they should expect from their experience. No one clearly differentiates the college experience from earlier educational experiences, so the student never gets an opportunity to make a fully informed decision. Consequently, they flounder, become frustrated and may even drop out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that one of the most important things that a college can do for its incoming students is to provide them with clear guidance on what a college education entails and what it provides (or doesn’t provide) in preparing them for their future.  Call it a ‘truth-in-education’ approach not unlike the truth-in-lending that you get when taking out a loan. It should be the first thing the student hears. And, perhaps, should even be what they hear &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they enroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students should be helped to understand that college provides two types of education: technical and human.  Now, I’ll probably go into these in more detail in later posts, but for now I’ll define them thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical education is education that is designed to provide the student with specific skills and knowledge that meets the requirements of specific career fields.  Think nursing, engineering, IT, business, and the like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Human” education or, if you prefer, “classic” education is designed to develop the intellectual capacity of the student.  I prefer the use of “human” simply because the focus is not on developing a specific skillset, but on developing the student’s human potential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite what many may say, one is not better than the other.  They are simply different. And which route the student takes is a reflection of her own values, personality, and interests.  Perhaps the biggest difference is that the student who chooses a “technical” route is choosing a clear, but limited career path while the student who chooses the “human” route has a less clear but, ultimately, more wide-open path.  Thus, while the IT graduate knows what her job options are and can encapsulate her skill set neatly by saying “I have a degree in programming”, the History graduate needs to take the time to inventory the skill set he has developed through his college experience and consider how that particular set of skills can be of benefit to an organization. It is of note that the skills that many organizations say they want in their employees are precisely the skills that the humanities graduates have developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing up front that the two types of education are different and what that difference means is essential to how a student understands their collegiate experience and its impact on their future.  Certainly there is not a huge demand for people who majored in English Literature. But there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a demand for employees who can read and interpret complex documents, who can write clearly and succinctly, and who can think creatively to solve problems.  And the English Lit student may be better positioned to do that than your average business major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleges are spending millions of dollars on advertising to draw students to their campuses and tens of thousands more on developing new and exciting programs.  Perhaps, in stead, they should invest in helping students see how the current programs can help them get ahead.  Simply explain what the college experience is all about.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <title> No, In Fact I Don&#39;t Like Social Media</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#No, In Fact I Don&amp;rsquo;t Like Social Media&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the title really says it all: I don’t like social media. The reasons, though, need some explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that social interaction and the sharing of ideas is an important part of life and, particularly, of learning. Engaging in thoughtful, thought-provoking conversations allows us to to explore more fully our own thinking, to consider the thoughts of others, and find in the mix a fuller, more well-developed sense of the world around us. For many years — perhaps hundreds — sitting with friends and debating the issues of the day was a common means of passing the time. Conversations no doubt got heated at times, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;and I’m sure more than few feelings got hurt. But, at the end of the day, they remained friends and may have developed a deeper appreciation for the knowledge and thoughts each held. And this, I think, is what the vision of social media started out to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well, the title really says it all: I don’t like social media. The reasons, though, need some explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that social interaction and the sharing of ideas is an important part of life and, particularly, of learning. Engaging in thoughtful, thought-provoking conversations allows us to to explore more fully our own thinking, to consider the thoughts of others, and find in the mix a fuller, more well-developed sense of the world around us.

But, at the end of the day, they remained friends and may have developed a deeper appreciation for the knowledge and thoughts each held. And this, I think, is what the vision of social media started out to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it hasn’t really worked out that way. At least not in my view. To be effective, such interaction needs to be local, personal and immediate. The image of a group of old men sitting around the potbelly stove in the general store on a cold, rainy day debating the issues of the day says a lot. They are friends who live and work in the same area and may well have grown up there. They may share many experiences. They may work in the same or closely allied fields. There’s history there that helps to put context to what is said. Joe knows that Sam is going to argue with him just for the sake of argument, regardless of what Sam might really believe. That shared existence and history provides a lens for understanding each other and the interactions between them. This doesn’t exist in the world of social media. There is no shared history, no ‘back story’ to the interactions between participants. There are only the words on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those guys sitting around that stove also know that they are part of the social fabric of the community and, as such, aren’t likely to attack each other. The same can’t be said for on-line social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is everywhere. You can’t watch TV without seeing the scroller run across the bottom of the screen showing you what others are saying on Twitter about the show. Watch the local news and you’ll be asked to “tell us what you think…” But, is this even necessary? Does what you think about a new story alter its value? Does the short, often emotional responses hastily written on these kinds of boards add value to the story? Not in my view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is almost an expectation that you participate in Facebook, Instragram, Pinterest, and the host of similar sites. If you’re not, people look at you as if you’ve some kind of pox. The very notion that I am expected to participate is unacceptable to me because the act of participating is seen as granting permission to attack me, to disparage my thoughts simply because they differ from yours. There is no respect for the thoughts of others and, perhaps most distressing is the simple reality that much of what passes as “social interaction” is little more than the constant parroting of ideas that are not original to the writer and which have not been truly considered for their veracity by the writer. In other words, ‘social’ media is not social at all, in my view; it’s just a forum for ill-informed bullies to continue their bullying without fear of reprisal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I avoid social media as much as I can. And that is why I don’t permit comments here. While I enjoy engaging in honest, thoughtful conversations, I find that such conversations just don’t exist on line. If you don’t like what I write, don’t read it. That is your choice. And it is my choice not to give others a forum for lambasting me for thinking about things differently than they do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fault of Not Reading</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-fault-of-not-reading&#34;&gt;The Fault of Not Reading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love to read. That’s a good thing, since I do quite a lot of it. After four years of forced reading as I progressed, first through my Masters degree and then the first three years of my doctorate, you’d think that I’d be tired of reading. Surprisingly, not only have I not grown tired of it, but I actually derive great pleasure from it. Still.  In fact, as my didactics ended in May, I immediately, and perhaps a bit too gleefully, read my way through four or five books both informational and entertaining.  Two or three by Malcolm Gladwell, a couple of Jack London’s tales, James Michener’s memoir, and a couple of rather old stories found on project &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Gutenberg.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Did I mention that I like to read? &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today, while browsing around the web, I ran across this &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;article&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; on thestoryreadingapeblog.com. While I generally deplore articles that are little more than lists of things designed to draw clicks to the article, I found the list here to be informative and useful, even if a bit shallow.  But it wasn’t the article that spurred me to write this post, but a comment found in the comments section of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blaming-without-thinking&#34;&gt;Blaming Without Thinking.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comment that caught my eye was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m stunned by the statistics of non-readers; it’s tragic. What a failure of our education systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m curious on what the commenter bases their comment. It would certainly be a failure if the reason why so many choose not to read is because they are unable to read. Most &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; read, but choose not to. So, is it a failure of the educational system because they prefer not to?  I don’t know. I don’t much care for math. I can &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; math, but I don’t see it as recreational. Is that lack of interest in math the fault of my teachers? Or, do I simply have different interests? There’s been a huge push in recent years to stimulate interest in science. Is the fact that some students aren’t turned on by things scientific a failure of the educational system, or simply a difference in interests? There are no easy answers to these and many other related questions, but I think that placing the blame on the educational system is a bit short-sighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading was once a common means of entertainment and the means for learning about the world around you, that is no longer true today.  Books compete with television, the internet, smart phones, game consoles, and host of other electronic gadgets, all vying for our attention and all providing glimpses, however, incomplete (and inaccurate) they may be. There is no need to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; something, when a gadget can be called on to provide the answer, whether it is a definition found on Wikipedia, or a result found by using the calculator app on our phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books engage our minds in wonderful ways. But they require work. They require a level of attention that is sometimes hard to muster in today’s fast paced environment. And they don’t engage the senses as much as video games do. Books take time to tell their story; a TV show does it in a hour – three, tops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, our culture has evolved. On a far broader scale than we’d like to admit, Americans don’t value education as highly as we once did. You might be inclined to disagree with me on that one, but think about the social status we grant our teachers. Think about the constant upheaval we’ve created around the educational system. Think about how often politicians vilify teachers in order to promote their own political agendas. And it has trickled down to the general populace. Nearly everyone acknowledges that teachers are the lynchpin in our economic future but, as that commenter did, any suggestion of failure is placed squarely on the shoulders of education, without consideration of moderating influences such as family, friends, and community. Oh, and don’t pay teachers more; they’re not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been quite a while since I posted anything here. I’ve been quite busy working through the remainder of my didactics, writing (and passing) my comprehensive exams, and beginning work on my prospectus.  But, I’m back trying to regain &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;some semblance of order in my life that includes sharing some of my ideas, thoughts, and observations on nursing, education, and a various sundry other things. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-long-time-coming&#34;&gt;A Long Time Coming&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been quite a while since I posted anything here. I’ve been quite busy working through the remainder of my didactics, writing (and passing) my comprehensive exams, and beginning work on my prospectus.  But, I’m back trying to regain &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;some semblance of order in my life that includes sharing some of my ideas, thoughts, and observations on nursing, education, and a various sundry other things. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-did-i-get-here&#34;&gt;How Did I Get Here?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the very first meeting of my cohort, we were asked to briefly explain how we came to be in the doctoral program.  When my turn came, I said, in all honesty, “I’m still trying to figure out how I got here!” And yet, I am now in the beginning stagses of my dissertation.  In all honesty I never expected to be here. A doctorate was never on my bucket list. After all, doctorates were for those far more brilliant and focused than I. There was almost something mystical about the process of obtaining a doctorate and something daunting about the fabled dissertation.  In my mind, the doctorate was something that other people pursued, not something that was within my reach. I was, after all, a fair-to-middling student, not the top of the class student that I imagined the doctoral student to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back now on my journey thus far I have to admit that it has been a much less daunting experience than I had imagined. Along the way it has lost much of its mystique. I no longer believe that the degree is reserved for only those most brilliant top-of-the-class folks. I’ve learned that most likely those folks whom I saw as such brilliant people are not doctors because they are brilliant, but are brilliant because they are doctors. The work of the education paved the way to brilliance far more than did any innate academic talent. That is to say, it’s mostly from hard work and commitment.  Even an average fellow like me can earn that title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fear-of-the-dissertation&#34;&gt;Fear of the Dissertation.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have digressed. Much of what kept me from pursuing a doctorate earlier was fear of the dissertation.  So many images had been fed to me of the the poor PhD student sequestered away in their room or laboratory for months on end, immersed in research on some arcane subject that a great fear of the beast had been instilled in me.  I don’t like research, I said. Yet I’ve found it now to be rather interesting. And I want to know more about it, and to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first began this doctoral journey I had no idea what I would choose as a dissertation topic.  I was, frankly, in awe of those who came in knowing what they wanted to focus on and had begun to feel a bit out of place casting about aimlessly looking for – I don’t know what.  I was counseled not to worry about the lack of a defined topic. Something in my studies would jump out and grab my attention and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; would be my topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe. But it certainly was not as easy as advertised.  It took quite a lot of soul-searching to clearly identify something that I felt a deep interest in and that I felt was worthy of investing the next year of my life. And, it’s still in its forming stagses, but I believe I have a topic. And in two weeks I present that to my committee.  We’ll see where that goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Meaning of a Degree</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-meaning-of-a-degree/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-meaning-of-a-degree/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-meaning-of-a-degree&#34;&gt;The Meaning of a Degree&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons why they may choose to do this are myriad. For some students, the BSN has long been a personal goal. For others, though, the decision isn’t internally motivated. Rather, they’re faced with either obtaining their BSN, or finding other employment. Now, for anyone outside of nursing, that latter reason might seem a bit harsh. But for those of us in the profession, it makes sense – at least to a degree. While I don’t disagree with the need for higher levels of education in nursing, I’m not so sure that the approach employers are using to encourage nurses to seek the BSN is the best approach. Let’s begin with a bit of background. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While I don’t disagree with the need for higher levels of education in nursing, I’m not so sure that the approach employers are using to encourage nurses to seek the BSN is the best approach. Let’s begin with a bit of background. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has shown a correlation between the level of nursing education and positive outcomes. That is, where the percentagse of baccalaureate prepared nurses is relatively high, there are fewer complications, slightly fewer deaths per 1000, and other benefits to the organization and to the patient. In addition, the Robert Wood Johnson/IOM has generated several reports over the years that also document the benefits of higher levels of nursing education and have consequently called on nursing schools, and employers to increase the numbers of practicing BSN level nurses.  the RWJ/IOM report has recommended that 80% of nurses be prepared at the BSN level by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more generic front, while all other healthcare disciplines have raised their educational requirements for entry to practice, nursing maintains the same educational requirements for entry to practice that have existed for more than 50 years. Times have changed, technologies have changed, knowledge has changed, and nursing needs to change in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third factor driving the push for nurses to get their BSN is something called “Magnet Status.” Magnet status is a designation made by the American Nurse Credentialing Center (ANCC) that recognizes hospitals for nursing excellence, quality patient care, and innovative nursing practices. Many organizations that either have achieved Magnet Status, or are working towards it, have established goals to increase the percentagse of BSN prepared nurses on staff. There are essentially three ways to achieve that goal: Hire only BSN nurses, encourage your current staff to go back to school, or decrease the number of non-BSN nurses on staff. The last two tend to work in concert and are often either transmitted, or interpreted, as “get your degree or lose you job.” Thus, many students are going back to school to keep their jobs, not because they are motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;just-give-me-the-degree&#34;&gt;Just give me the degree&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that most educators would agree that external motivators, particularly negative motivators don’t lead to particularly good learning outcomes. And this is what I see. I can almost always immediately identify the student who comes to school “because I have to.” They are the ones who don’t want to do the work. They are the ones who complain about everything. They are the ones who become frustrated because they “don’t understand” what is expected of them because they are so busy just trying to rush through that they didn’t bother to read the syllabus – or the assigned materials. There is very much of a “Just give me the degree” mentality.  And that is, to me, very sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I try to communicate to students is that it isn’t just a piece of paper. That degree &lt;em&gt;means something&lt;/em&gt;. When you tell someone you possess a degree, you are telling that you possess certain knowledge and skills that aren’t as easily found in those without the degree.  It’s not just about technical skills and knowledge. The BSN level nurse has a greater understanding of how things work together, how they interact. She is better prepared to see relationships, and to understand those relationships. She is better able to identify and anticipate the sequelae of patient situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also about being able to read, understand, and implement the findings of nursing and medical research to benefit the patient and/or the organization – or themselves. It’s about being able to talk cogently with other medical professionals about patient situations to work collaboratively to improve outcomes. It’s about improving the position of nursing within the healthcare structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, I think, indicative of the level of understanding that many ADN nurses see no difference between themselves and the BSN nurse. It is true that many BSN nurses, particularly straight out of school, work along side the ADN nurse, doing the same job. And, it is likely true that many don’t have the technical skills that the ADN nurse has on graduation. But what the ADN nurse doesn’t see is that the BSN nurse brings a different skillset to the table. The physical skills can be quickly and easily learned. What is more difficult to learn, and what the BSN prepared nurse generally does bring to the table, are the intellectual skills needed to see and anticipate problems before they occur, the awareness and understanding of research that impacts practice, and the importance of that research on patient outcomes. The ADN nurse, of course, can certainly develop those skills over time, but it is the orderly development of those skills through education that hastens the process for the baccalaureate nurse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-value-of-the-degree&#34;&gt;What is the value of the degree?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the long run,  I believe that it is vital that we increase the number of BSN level (and higher) nurses. The value of the higher degree has been demonstrated through multiples studies. And, as nurses, we should be committed to doing anything that we can to improve the quality of care that we provide to benefit the patient. What is the value of the degree? To me it is the value of the we improved through our own improved knowledge and skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About eight years ago I spent a couple of years teaching high school. Being a nurse, and coming into the experience with no real educational background it was quite an interesting, and eye-opening experience. Needless to say, I probably learned more than my students did. One of the things that left me scratching my head was the approach the school system took toward education. Tons of money was spent on technology and teachers were required to have at least one “technology lesson” each week. That lesson had to be so designated on your weekly lesson plan. Talk about misguided! As I write this I still see a lot of the same things happening in education — at all levels. And it’s just plain dumb. Let’s explore this a bit. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Tons of money was spent on technology and teachers were required to have at least one “technology lesson” each week. That lesson had to be so designated on your weekly lesson plan. Talk about misguided! As I write this I still see a lot of the same things happening in education — at all levels. And it’s just plain dumb. Let’s explore this a bit. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;build-it-and-they-will-come&#34;&gt;Build It and They Will Come&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s suppose, for a moment, that I’m running a for profit business. Where and when I spend money is determined by the needs that spending that money will meet. Outside of research and development it is unlikely that I would spend large sums of money on equipment and software for which I don’t already have a defined purpose. Stating that a bit differently, purchases are driven by the need the purchase will meet. A businessman would be foolish to spend large sums of money on a piece of equipment then turn to his staff and say, “well, here it is. Figure out how we can use it!” But that’s what schools do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the metrics used to judge school systems, apparently, is the technology available within the system.  Thus, IT leaders in education become focused on procuring equipment and software that they can then point to as evidence of their “forward thinking” and/or their technologic support of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, often that technology sits in the classroom unused. Why? Three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.    The technology is purchased without a clear purpose in mind. No one asks the question: What instructional need is this purchase fulfilling? With no clear instructional purpose, the equipment is simply not used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.    While money was spent to buy the equipment and software, little or no money is spent to train teachers to use it.  Shown how to use the technology, and how it can be beneficial in the classroom, I think many teachers would be accepting of new technologies. However, this is seldom done. They’re left to their own motivation. That leads us to the third problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.    Teachers already have a lot on their plates. They have no motivation to learn new technologies that may not have value in their classrooms. That is, with so many competing priorities in teaching today, teachers don’t want to spend time trying to learn a technology that may not be of benefit in moving them toward the goal of educating their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT directors in schools should be educators and they should be capable of evaluating the utility of the technologies in the classroom setting. Purchases should be driven not by a desire to “look good” on some report, or by a desire to “try out” new technologies, but by the need in the classroom. Interestingly, it seems that often the decisions are made without input from teachers and when teachers do make recommendations, or requests for specific technologies, their input is ignored or minimized. Heaven forbid that a faculty member should request software, or access to an online technology that they have determined would be beneficial to their classroom. Their request may well be denied. After all, who are they to evaluate software? And, there’s likely to be no money in the budget for such requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;technology-for-technologys-sake&#34;&gt;Technology for Technology’s Sake&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I note above, the idea of having at least one “technology lesson plan” each week is equally ludicrous.  Technology should always be the tool to achieving an outcome. Unless you’re teaching a technology course, the technology should not be the focus. Like buying equipment without a purpose, using technology (or requiring its use) when it contributes little to the outcomes is ridiculous for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.    Not all topics benefit from the use of technology. As adjunctive activities technology-based activities might have a place in some classrooms. For example, using storyboarding software to create a storyboard of a reading in a literature class might be beneficial in reinforcing what is learned. On the other hand, simply having the student prepare a PowerPoint on the topic likely does no more for learning than having them take notes. Why not just have them take notes, instead of introducing the complexity of the software into the equation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.    Teachers seldom have the level of skill needed to teach students how to use the technology— I”m an English teacher, not a computer teacher, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.    A corollary to  #2 is that students are often significantly more sophisticated in their ability to use current technologies than are their teachers. So, the teacher assigns the creation of a PowerPoint (which students have now done hundreds of times) and the student is bored. Why not allow the student to select a technology to use to present an idea? I’m betting theirs would be much more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are other reasons, but I’ll let you add them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point in all of this is that technology is, and should be seen as, a tool in the teacher’s toolbox. You would never hand someone a wrench and tell them to figure out how to build a house with it. Neither should you demand that teachers use a specific technology in their classrooms. Teachers should always be free to choose the tools that best meet the needs of the classroom. But, to help them understand the tools available to them, they should be properly trained in the use of all their tools, not just a few. Finally, teachers should feel free to request  and be allowed to use whatever resources they feel best meet the needs of their classroom. It should never be the IT director’s decision on what is appropriate for the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is it for Education or Business?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/is-it-for-education-or-business/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-it-for-education-or-business&#34;&gt;Is it for Education or Business?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1990’s as I was preparing to wrap up my MBA I was informed by my advisor that I still needed to take a basic statistics course. Now, that would seem a reasonable expectation were it not for the fact that I had already completed two advanced statistics courses. Being a bit obstinate, I asked why it was necessary for me to take a course designed to prepare me for courses that I had already taken and passed (quite well, I might add.) The response – not surprisingly – was that it was a necessary part of the degree and, therefore, could not be waived. That introductory statistics course, the one designed to prepare me for higher level courses, was the last course I took before graduating. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-it-for-education-or-business&#34;&gt;Is it for Education or Business?&lt;/h1&gt;

That introductory statistics course, the one designed to prepare me for higher level courses, was the last course I took before graduating. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems reasonable to me that educated, rational people would recognize how ludicrous it is to demand strict adherence to a course of study designed to teach me something, that I have clearly already mastered. It seems reasonable to me that highly educated, rational people would recognize that the purpose of education is not to check off boxes on a list to provide an educational experience. It seems reasonable to me that highly educated, rational people would recognize that the purpose of a class has been fulfilled when a student has succeeded in a higher level course. Alas, what seems reasonable to me is, apparently, not reasonable to those highly educated, rational people called University Administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-it-continues-&#34;&gt;And it Continues …&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped that with the passage of twenty years, the continuous evolution of the educational environment, and pressure from various sources to look carefully at the products of today’s higher educational systems, changes would have come. I had hoped that blind adherence to a “course of study” would have given way to a more rational view of the learning experience. With an increasing number of “non-traditional” student (meaning, among other things, second career students) I would have expected a bit more acknowledgement of prior experience in the educational sphere. Certainly a twenty year career in management provides knowledge and experience that exceeds anything likely to be presented in a classroom! But, alas, it appears I am wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I move into my spring term, I am preparing to begin a “practicum” experience designed to introduce me to the faculty role. For a young student, for a student who lacks experience in the field, these practica can be immensely instructive. But, how will the 240 hours of practicum contribute to the more than 18,000 hours of experience I have in the role? To be frank, I’m doubtful I’ll get much out of it. Like the introductory statistics course from twenty years ago, this course is designed to provide with the foundational skills necessary for success in subsequent experiences. The problem is – as it was twenty years ago – I have already mastered the role that the course is designed to prepare me for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-the-alternative&#34;&gt;And the Alternative?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taught secondary ed for a couple of years. For students who quickly mastered the basic content of the course we had enrichment activities that built on their basic knowledge. These activities allowed the brighter student to extend and deepen their knowledge about the topic while allowing their classmates time to master material with which they may be struggling. This makes sense. Repeating material already learned is wasted effort.  Building on that material is not only good time utilization, but good use of effort. And, in the end the student is all the more successful. This concept apparently hasn’t made it to the collegiate level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, those of us who share significant experience as faculty at the undergraduate level sought to pursue that practicum at the graduate level. We wanted to gain experience in a role that was different from our histories. But, no. That is not possible, for it is not the goal of the course. So, I’ll be working 64+ hours a week between my full-time job and the practicum experience (not to mention the study time for the two other courses I’ll be taking) and will get to pay $1000 more for the privilege of being “introduced” into a role I’ve held for nine years. So, Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious answer to this question is rooted in the very same issues that have grabbed so many headlines in recent years. Money. By allowing a student to bypass a course that they clearly do not need, the university is missing out on the revenue that course would generate. And this simply will not do!  Yet, it seems to me that helping students to manage costs should be part of the university’s mission. I wonder how this may change as MOOCs make inroads in the educational landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I can only hope that as I continue to add to my academic resume that I won’t lose the common sense that tells me something is decidedly wrong with this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*\&lt;/em&gt;* End of Rant ***&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Education &#34;All That&#34;?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/is-education-all-that/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-education-all-that&#34;&gt;Is Education &amp;ldquo;All That&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a wonderful opportunity to talk with a woman(we’ll call her Jane) who has accomplished several things that I have only dreamed of. She has developed a new approach to an old and vexing problem many nurses face, she contributed to the development of a new medical device, she has been published in peer-reviewed journals, and has spoken around the world before thousands of people to introduce other professionals to both her new technique and to the medical device. She can confidently say that the approach she developed is being used in health care settings around the world. And she has an associate’s degree — the minimum level of education required to become a nurse.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-education-all-that&#34;&gt;Is Education &amp;ldquo;All That&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h1&gt;

She can confidently say that the approach she developed is being used in health care settings around the world. And she has an associate’s degree — the minimum level of education required to become a nurse.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without that last sentence I have no doubt that you would have expected that I would have introduced her as Doctor Jane, indicating her PhD in nursing or some allied field. But she is not; she is minimally educated for her profession. And there’s the rub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have become so trained that more education is always the way to wealth, fame, and fortune that we have really, I think, overlooked the real drivers of accomplishing things like Jane has done: Curiosity, creativity, and drive. The simple fact is I know quite a number of highly educated people who have not, and will not, accomplish what Jane has done.  Or anything close to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get bashed for bashing higher education, don’t misunderstand my meaning. higher education has a place (I”m banking heavily on it!) The lead author of Jane’s article is a PhD educated nurse researcher. There’s little doubt that it was with her colleague’s guidance that Jane wrote and published what she did. But he didn’t develop the technique; she did. His role was to help her evangelize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we also need to remember that without creativity, curiosity, and drive no amount of education will lead to new ideas, or new products. What scares me sometimes, though, is that it seems that we are “educating” these traits out of our students. Peter Gray, a research psychologist at Boston College penned &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;this article&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; about the creativity killing effects of traditional education with its focus on high-stakes testing. For years before, I have questioned education’s role in developing or squelching a child’s innate creativity. You can teach techniques in art, for example, or the mechanics of playing a musical instrument. One wonders what Pablo Picasso’s art would have been had he remained at the Royal Academy of San Fernando, Spain’s foremost art school of the time. How different would the Apple computer be if Steve Jobs had remained in college? Would there even &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; and Apple computer? Jobs, for example, famously dropped out of Reed College only to later audit courses that “interested” him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be sure, not everyone who charts their own path will be as successful as Jobs, or Picasso, and others who have made their mark in the world despite lacking higher education credentials. My point isn’t to argue that education isn’t necessary. On the contrary, it is highly necessary. None of the things that have been accomplished — even by people like Steve Jobs — would have been possible had they not been educated. But their educational path was one of their choosing. They eschewed the traditional structured process of formal education in favor of an educational path that was driven by their interests. Consequently they learned more and achieved more because they were curious about a topic, driven to learn more, and creative in how they apply that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The State of the MOOC</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-state-of-the-mooc/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-state-of-the-mooc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-state-of-the-mooc&#34;&gt;The State of the MOOC&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent articles about &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Massive Open Online Courses&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; (MOOC) got my attention this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fail&#34;&gt;Fail?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/10/new-study-low-mooc-completion-rates&#34;&gt;first article&lt;/a&gt; brings to the fore the reality that only about 7% of those who start a MOOC course complete it. This is, of course, a major concern for educators, given that completion rates are the major metric for colleges. It is completely understandable that many would see that number and conclude that MOOCs are failing. I’m not sure I agree with that assessment for several reasons.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-state-of-the-mooc&#34;&gt;The State of the MOOC&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent articles about &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Massive Open Online Courses&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; (MOOC) got my attention this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fail&#34;&gt;Fail?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/10/new-study-low-mooc-completion-rates&#34;&gt;first article&lt;/a&gt; brings to the fore the reality that only about 7% of those who start a MOOC course complete it. This is, of course, a major concern for educators, given that completion rates are the major metric for colleges. It is completely understandable that many would see that number and conclude that MOOCs are failing. I’m not sure I agree with that assessment for several reasons.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it’s important to remember that MOOCs are a new and novel concept that has received a tremendous amount of public press. Many people are curious to know what the hype is all about and may well have signed up to take a course simply to see what the hype was all about. Once their curiosity was satisfied they dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other students may have signed up with specific learning needs on the topic. Once their learning needs were satisfied they, too, dropped out. This is one of the benefits of the ‘open’ aspect of the MOOC; students are free to come and go as they please, according to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third factor is the low, or no cost, aspect of the MOOC. One of the basic concepts of the MOOC is that the courses are available at little or no cost. This has, I think, two implications. The first is that the low, or no, cost of the course means the student has nothing to lose by signing up. This could lead to many students signing up for courses. The second implication is that with no “skin in the game” the student has no real incentive to work hard to achieve. Fowler (2013) points out a Coursera study that finds that students who pay $30 – $60 for an Identify Verification service associated with the course are “significantly” more likely to complete the course.  Surely cost, and having skin in the game, makes a difference on completion rates. At the same, time, I’m not sure which comes first. Are they more likely to complete &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they paid the fee, or are they more likely to pay the fee because they want to complete the course?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final reason, at least in my mind, is that many MOOCs are simply poorly designed and, as a consequence, students found the format unpalatable. MOOCs are based on some very specific concepts. One of those concepts is that students contribute to the learning process with the faculty serving as guide.  In other words, students are actively involved in their education. Many courses, however, appear to be highly structured courses with an over-reliance on video lectures and assigned reading. Students simply don’t want to sit passively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;who-are-moocs-for&#34;&gt;Who are MOOCs for?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no question that completion is an issue, it turns out that the one who are completing already have some &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/moocs-are-reaching-only-privileged-learners-survey-finds/48567&#34;&gt;college-level education&lt;/a&gt; — usually at least a baccalaureate degree. This comes as a bit of surprise, apparently, to some of the folk who felt that MOOCs would be the salvation for underprivileged students. Frankly, I’m not surprised. The design of MOOCs require the student to bring the ability to study independently to the table. Moreover, the concepts that underly the MOOC rely on student interest and motivation. The undergraduate student often lacks both the skills needed for independent study and the motivation and interest to seek out the knowledge the course is intended to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the MOOC has a couple of  very specific niche markets. I think that MOOCs are great resources for the individual who wants to know more about some topic without necessarily wanting a degree. These individuals are motivated to learn, not because they need the degree but because they want to know more. These folk, not surprisingly, are often already well educated. Their motivation might be to gain the knowledge to move into a new position or to deepen their knowledge for a position they’ve recently been promoted into. Or, it may simply be to fulfill a curiosity. Many well-educated people tend to expand their interests into new areas. The MOOC is a perfect vehicle for meeting that interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These well-educated people also bring a history of study skills to the table, making the MOOC not only more appealing to them, but making them more likely to be successful in that environment. This is one of the major issues, in my view, for those considering offering MOOCs to undergraduate students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;wrapping-it-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping it Up…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that MOOCs are a potentially valuable way for people to learn new skills that they need to improve their work situations, or to expand their interests. On the other hand, I don’t think that they are the best option for teaching students who are not already well versed in studying. Stay tuned, though, because things are always subject to change!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So, What&#39;s This Site All About?</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-whats-this-site-all-about&#34;&gt;So, What&amp;rsquo;s This Site All About?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the web … yes, I know that’s a bit cliché but … well, what can I say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am a doctoral student in Education (Nursing education to be precise) and have decided to use a blogging platform as a means for storing ideas and thoughts related to topics that might be useful as I move toward my dissertation. And, it’s a great way to begin stretching my writing legs, solidify ideas, and perhaps my thinking to a bit of public scrutiny, as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am a doctoral student in Education (Nursing education to be precise) and have decided to use a blogging platform as a means for storing ideas and thoughts related to topics that might be useful as I move toward my dissertation. And, it’s a great way to begin stretching my writing legs, solidify ideas, and perhaps my thinking to a bit of public scrutiny, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’ll find here will likely be pretty much an amalgam of ideas, thoughts, random rants, and explorations of concepts related to MOOCs, learning via social media, learning commons and the like. Oh, and I’ll probably throw in the occasional exploration of software related to writing, research and such (particularly as they relate to dissertations!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thought … I welcome public discourse on my ideas; that’s how ideas grow and develop. If you choose to contribute, great! But, be aware that if your idea of contributing is flaming, trolling and so forth your posts will be deleted and you will be banned. Let’s grow together, not tear each other down ..&lt;/p&gt;
