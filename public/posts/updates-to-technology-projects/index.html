        <h1 id="updates-to-technology-projects">Updates to Technology Projects<a href="#updates-to-technology-projects" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had several technology projects running for a while now and thought it was time for an update.</p>
<h3 id="nextcloud-onlyoffice-and-the-like">Nextcloud, OnlyOffice, and the Like<a href="#nextcloud-onlyoffice-and-the-like" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Back in February I set up a Nextcloud server and incorporated OnlyOffice.  The concepts are pretty cool, but I have abandoned both of those projects.  In all honesty, having completed my dissertation, I write so little that requires a word processor that I&rsquo;ve not yet found a need for OnlyOffice. And when I do need such <!-- raw HTML omitted -->services, I have LibreOffice available on all of my computers.  MS Office is on its way out since I no longer need to power of a word processor for my writing and my licenses are beginning to expire. (I still have a couple of licenses that will be expiring soon.)</p>
<p>In terms of document storage, I haven&rsquo;t figured out what benefit Nextclod provides me over a simple document storage device such as my linux server.  I can access everything I need via the VPN.  This approach not only helps keep my data more secure by not opening it to the web, but just streamlines the whole process.</p>
<h3 id="jekyll">Jekyll<a href="#jekyll" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Another project I started back in the fall was to use Jekyll for my website.  I am quite conversant in database design, management, etc and fully understand the benefits that a database e.g.  Mysql, postresql, etc can provide.  On the other hand, I also know how difficult it is to move your writing to another platform or to simply extract your work in a human-readable way.  The promise of Jekyll and other plaintext platforms is that you can write and store your writing in a human readable format that can easily be moved to different platforms, printed, or otherwise shared with ease. As you may infer from this site, however, I&rsquo;ve moved to Grav, which is a bit more intuitive and easier to work with.</p>
<p>Several factors led to that decision.  Probably the most signficant is that creating a new post required too many steps.  Not only did I have to write and store the document in a specific location, I then had to run a script that would recompile the entire site, then upload the entire site to the webserver.  That doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. And, to accomplish this required that I either remember the various commands for compiling the site and uploading it, or remember where I put the script that would run the commands for me.  If it&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a post, there was no guarantee that I&rsquo;d remember these things.</p>
<p>Grav provides an option to use the writing tools through the admin page of the website to write, or I can write off-line and simply upload the one file to the server.  No fuss, no muss, and the page is immediately live.  Grav may present a little bigger hit on the server itself as it processes the page, but probably no more so than would be seen if I was using a database driven site.</p>
<p>I did look at several alternatives, including YellowCMS, and Bludit.  I actually liked Bludit quite a lot and would have chosen it but for the fact that it lacked the ability to simply upload a page written offline.  It stores its page data in a JSON database file which would have required that I either write all my posts within the site, or manually update several JSON files in order to get everything set up correctly.  Not an appealing prospect.</p>
<h3 id="self-hosted-bookmark-site">Self-Hosted Bookmark Site<a href="#self-hosted-bookmark-site" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Three projects that are rocking along well are the self-hosted bookmark, the RSS reader, and the read-it-later sites that I created.  Both of these run on a Raspberry Pi and work very well. In fact, I use all three relatively routinely.</p>
<h4 id="shaarli">Shaarli<a href="#shaarli" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>After playing with several other scripts (Unmark, SemanticScuttle, and Shaarl, as well as a couple of others that I don&rsquo;t now remember) I settled on Shaarli.  I can&rsquo;t really say why, other than it seems to be the one that best meshed with how I work.  SemanticScuttle is still up and running and I do have bookmarks stored there, but I rarely send anything to it.  For this one, Shaarli wins the day.</p>
<h4 id="freshrss">FreshRSS<a href="#freshrss" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I really wrote about an RSS reader earlier but I played with several over the course of several months.  I realize that RSS reader use may be on the decline but I like being able to quickly scan headlines of my favorite sites.  I have to manually mark the entries read and to manually refresh the page to update the headlines, but that&rsquo;s okay.  I find FreshRSS useful and that&rsquo;s what counts.</p>
<h4 id="wallabag">Wallabag<a href="#wallabag" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Was there ever a question that Wallabag would persist? Not for me.  I&rsquo;m not sure why I never really cottoned to Pocket.  It does the same thing as Wallabag, but for whatever reason I find Wallabag useful.  I try to keep my reading list there pruned so I don&rsquo;t end up with hundreds of unread pages.  But being able to save not only the bookmark to a page, but also the content of that page is quite useful.  I also like that the advertising is stripped from the pages and they are made more readable and easier to print if  I want to keep a hard-copy of a particular article.  Pocket may have those capacities (I&rsquo;m sure they do) but Wallabag is the service for me and it runs on my servers, keeping things simple and ensuring that they won&rsquo;t suddenly disappear when the company goes under.</p>
<p>There you have it: updates to several of my technology projects.</p>
