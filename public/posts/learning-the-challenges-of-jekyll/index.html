<p>So a few days ago I decided to use Jekyll to generate a static website to host
all &ndash; well, most &ndash; of my writing.  Jekyll, I&rsquo;ve learned, is a different beast
from most applications used for these purposes.  I&rsquo;ve found several themes that
I really liked, but they all had some sort of quirks that made them less easy to
use.  I&rsquo;m finding, though, that &ldquo;easy to use&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jekyll&rdquo; probably don&rsquo;t belong
in the same sentence. Each of the themes I&rsquo;ve looked at require slightly
different structures, use categories differently, and just generally appear
rather finicky.  I&rsquo;m sure for people that have played with it for quite a while, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
these quirks are just part of the landscape. For people like me, who haven&rsquo;t
really spent much time with the software, it&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>
<h3 id="making-links-work">Making Links Work<a href="#making-links-work" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>One of the challenges that I&rsquo;ve encountered is making links work from the
dynamically created pages..  Say
for
example, I have a a post entitled, &ldquo;Blogging with Jekyll&rdquo;. When I generate the
site, Jekyll automatically creates a link to that post.  BUT, some of the themes
I played with didn&rsquo;t generate the full link. They pointed me to the title, but
had not appended the &lsquo;.html&rsquo; to the page. The result? A blank page.  It took
some Googling around to find out that adding the &lsquo;.html&rsquo; to the end of the
&lsquo;:title&rsquo; part of the permalink fixed the problem.  Simple fix, once I finally
found it, but why was that ever a problem? Why wasn&rsquo;t the &lsquo;.html&rsquo; added by the
theme creator?  Surely his or her copy of the script didn&rsquo;t work without that
extension, either.  Not sure what I mean?</p>
<p>In the _config.yml file I found:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-permalink:" data-lang="permalink:">
What is needed is 
 permalink:           /:title.html
</code></pre><p>x
Again, simple fix &hellip;.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-problems">Navigation Problems.<a href="#navigation-problems" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Similarly, I wanted a theme that included navigation so that anyone reading the
site could move around within it.  One of the themes I really like didn&rsquo;t have
navigation.  I probably could have added it but, frankly, didn&rsquo;t want to take
the time to figure it out.  So, I settled for one that included navigation.<br>
Except that the navigation didn&rsquo;t work correctly.  I&rsquo;m not working from my
webserver root, so a baseurl is needed.  The navigation (home, back, and next
buttons) didn&rsquo;t account for a non-root structure.  So, after a bit of plugging
about I finally found the template that contains thenavigation links (they&rsquo;re
not
always in the same
place from one theme to another). Search about until I found the right variables
to include.  Now, I have:</p>
<p><code>{% raw %}{{ site.baseurl }}\{{ page.previous.url }} {% endraw %}</code></p>
<p>This works correctly.  I had to do this for the home button, as well as the
previous and next buttons.  And, I&rsquo;m sure as I continue to work with the site,
I&rsquo;ll find other things like this.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>As it stands right now, I&rsquo;ll use this theme.  As I work more with the scripts,
I&rsquo;m beginning to understand them a little better.  But I&rsquo;d much rather spend my
time writing than trying to fix the platform that I&rsquo;m using to host that
writing.  Yes, Wordpress or some such would have been easier, but, as I said in
<a href="../blogging-with-jekyll">this post</a> I
really
do think that a database driven website is overkill for my needs.</p>
