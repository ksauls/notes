      <description>The Power of Curiosity I have always been a curious person. I&amp;rsquo;m the kid that took toys apart to see how they worked (and was sometimes able to put them back together again, too!) I was the kid that enjoyed reading the WorldBook Encyclopedia because, well, just because. Learning about different stuff fascinated me. Even as a very small child I was curious. My mother used to tell the story of the time when I was maybe 3 or 4 years old and came in crying because my eyes were filled with sand.</description>

      <description>Blogging with Jekyll Over the past nearly 10 years I&amp;rsquo;ve tried numerous times to maintain a blog. I enjoy writing and figured it would be a good way not only to practice the skill, but to share my thoughts with others. I don&amp;rsquo;t really care whether anyone reads my work, to be honest; I just want to write. The problem is that, while I don&amp;rsquo;t care so much if I&amp;rsquo;m read, I do want to be able to keep my files and refer back to them from time to time &amp;ndash; something of a journal (which is what the blog was originally conceived to be).</description>
