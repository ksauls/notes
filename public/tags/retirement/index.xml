      <description>Putting My Second Act into Perspective Six months ago I retired after forty years of nursing practice. One of the things I was told when I retired was that I would get bored within three months.&#xA;Uh.&#xA;No.&#xA;As I told a former co-worker, I&amp;rsquo;m busier now than when I was working. The difference is that I&amp;rsquo;m doing what interests me, what I want to do, rather than what I&amp;rsquo;m required to do by someone else.</description>
