      <description>Moving from Exchange to Zoho Mail Somewhere back around 2011 or 2012 I moved from my ISP&amp;rsquo;s email service to Microsoft Office 365 Business plan that offered access to MS Exchange server.

The course was provide through a state university in cooperation with that company and in conjunction with a state level push to encourage tech companies to settle in Georgia. I ended up not taking a job with that company.</description>
