      <title>Using the Right Tool for the Job</title>

      <description>Back in the late 1980&amp;rsquo;s, when I first began working with computers, there were a fairly wide variety of devices and OSes from which to choose. TRS-80, Commodore (I had the C-128), MS-Dos based PCs, Apple, Amiga, and so on. The challenge was to determine which device worked best for your intended use. DOS based PCs were best for office type work, Apple was the choice if you were doing multimedia, Amiga for gaming, etc.</description>

      <description>Driving a Hybrid Pickup Truck I drove a 2000 Ford Ranger for over 20 years. I loved that truck and basically just wore it out. I think when I finally sold it in 2021 I had put over 250K miles on it. But, alas, all good things come to an end and as it got longer in the tooth it began to have more problems, with their associated costs, than I was willing to deal with.</description>

      <description>Doing Unix-y Things In an earlier post I noted that my foray into Linux began when I started an intensive program in network administration, etc back in 2000. That&amp;rsquo;s not precisely true. That course did not teach me anything about Linux. I don&amp;rsquo;t even recall it being mentioned. What it did teach me was Unix. Sun Solaris Unix, to be precise, running on a Sun Sparc server (rest their souls). Linux came along a bit later.</description>

      <title>Why Do People Use Chromeos</title>

      <description>Why Do People Use ChromeOS? It seems like people have jumping on the ChromeOS bandwagon in droves since the first Chromebooks debuted in 2011. The draw, as I understand it, was that the laptops were small and inexpensive and required little knowledge of computing. Boot it up, create a Google account (if you didn&amp;rsquo;t already have one), and go. Schools and even businesses bought into the ecosystem quickly. Today many schools are almost entirely connected using Chromebooks and often students are given a Chromebook for them to take home and use.</description>

      <title>Moving from Exchange to Zoho Mail</title>

      <description>Moving from Exchange to Zoho Mail Somewhere back around 2011 or 2012 I moved from my ISP&amp;rsquo;s email service to Microsoft Office 365 Business plan that offered access to MS Exchange server. I had previously toyed with using Gmail&amp;rsquo;s services with my own domain name but didn&amp;rsquo;t find that it met my specific needs. Too, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t have a great love for Gmail.&#xA;My motivation for moving, as I recall now more than a dozen years later, is that I was starting my doctoral studies and needed to be able to coordinate more easily with classmates, access calendars and documents across multiple platforms, and generally have better control over my workflows.</description>

      <description>My History with Self-Hosting My journey with Linux started in the summer of 2020 when I enrolled in an intensive course in IT designed for a specific ISP (which no longer exists). The course was provide through a state university in cooperation with that company and in conjunction with a state level push to encourage tech companies to settle in Georgia. I ended up not taking a job with that company.</description>

      <description>PlainText Preferences Over the last ten years there have been a couple of preferences that have driven many of my technology decisions. One is a preference for using plain text rather than proprietary software. The other is a preference for flat files over databases.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk about Plain Text My move toward plain text came about for several reasons.&#xA;First, I just wanted to take notes that I could quickly create and reference as needed.</description>

      <description>My Wife Always Wanted to Marry a Pilot A Bit of Background I became interested in drones in the spring of 2021. My wife was preparing to retire from her teaching gig and considering a new career in real estate. After 15 years in our relatively small town in the mountains of North Georgia, we were planning a move to a little larger town with fewer challenging hills and more conveniences.</description>

      <description>I Don&amp;rsquo;t Trust Gmail. Here&amp;rsquo;s Why. I have had an email address with Gmail for probably 20 years. I mean my email address is my name @ Gmail. No numbers, no weird abbreviations, no strange punctuations, just my firstnamelastname @gmail.com How long has it been since that was possible?&#xA;Three or four years ago I began receiving emails to my address that were clearly intended for another person with my same name.</description>

      <description>Nextcloud, OnlyOffice, and the Like Every once in a while I get this notion that I need to move my data off of sites like Dropbox, OneDrive, and so forth. When I do, I start playing around with self-hosted services such as NextCloud, OwnCloud, and so forth. I&amp;rsquo;m currently in one of those cycles and have been playing around a good bit with Nextcloud.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve even coupled it with OnlyOffice so that I can edit documents in the</description>

      <description>Moving to a Self-Hosted Bookmarking Service There&amp;rsquo;s a hint that bookmarks are going away. Services like Delicious that used to provide great web-based book marking services have closed down. In their place are the likes of Instapaper and Pinboard and the like that break stuff into different types. Instapaper to store sites that you want to read later, Pinterest for images you like, and so forth. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well for me, though.</description>

      <description>Technology For It&amp;rsquo;s Own Sake About eight years ago I spent a couple of years teaching high school. Being a nurse, and coming into the experience with no real educational background it was quite an interesting, and eye-opening experience. Needless to say, I probably learned more than my students did. One of the things that left me scratching my head was the approach the school system took toward education. Tons of money was spent on technology and teachers were required to have at least one “technology lesson” each week.</description>

      <title>The State of the MOOC</title>

      <description>The State of the MOOC Two recent articles about Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) got my attention this week.&#xA;Fail? The first article brings to the fore the reality that only about 7% of those who start a MOOC course complete it. This is, of course, a major concern for educators, given that completion rates are the major metric for colleges. It is completely understandable that many would see that number and conclude that MOOCs are failing.</description>
