      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the late 1980&amp;rsquo;s, when I first began working with computers, there were a fairly wide variety of devices and OSes from which to choose.  TRS-80, Commodore (I had the C-128), MS-Dos based PCs, Apple, Amiga, and so on.  The challenge was to determine which device worked best for your intended use.  DOS based PCs were best for office type work, Apple was the choice if you were doing multimedia, Amiga for gaming, etc.  While you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do anything on most of those devices, each had particular strengths and weaknesses.  The question you faced in making a purchase was, &amp;ldquo;which device is best for what I want to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

DOS based PCs were best for office type work, Apple was the choice if you were doing multimedia, Amiga for gaming, etc.  While you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do anything on most of those devices, each had particular strengths and weaknesses.  The question you faced in making a purchase was, &amp;ldquo;which device is best for what I want to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure there were folks who asked why a particular device didn&amp;rsquo;t do &amp;ldquo;such-and-so&amp;rdquo; but, for the most part, it was understood that different platforms had different options. Despite having been adopted by businesses early on (Thanks, IBM) the MS-DOS PC didn&amp;rsquo;t have a spreadsheet program.  The first spreadsheet, VisiCalc, was introduced on the Apple, so if a business wanted to leverage that application, they invested in an Apple machine, they didn&amp;rsquo;t carp about VisiCalc not being available on the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the industry has pretty well consolidated in a way that blurs the lines between the various devices and their OSes.  Many of the manufacturers of computers have evaporated and their OSes have disappeared.  What remains are really three major  players (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux) and one minor player (BSD), along with a few &amp;ldquo;also rans&amp;rdquo; (Haiku, BeOS, etc). These are centered around two primary hardware platforms &amp;ndash; Apple, and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work primarily with Mac OS, though I also have numerous Linux and even BSD machines.  Linux and BSD are used for what they&amp;rsquo;re best suited for &amp;ndash; servers. My Mac OS devices are my daily drivers and what I use for web browsing, email, writing, tracking finances, etc. The Mac is also what I do video and photo editing on. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that I don&amp;rsquo;t do Linux (or BSD) desktop &amp;ndash; I do.  I just don&amp;rsquo;t currently use those desktops regularly. And the reason is rather mundane: the M2 Mac Mini is what sits on my desktop and my Intel Macbook Air (2020 model) is what lives in the living room for quick browsing when I&amp;rsquo;m not at my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do own a Windows 10 device, though it generally sits on a shelf, waiting to be turned on for those rare occasions when I have no other option because the software I need is only available on Windows (PlayOn TV, for example).   Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss my reasons for avoiding Windows at some later date. Or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I noted in an earlier post I have begun exploring FreeBSD.  Anytime you&amp;rsquo;re learning a new system, program, service, etc. you tend to peruse the forums and message boards for hints, tips, and answers to specific issues you encounter.  One of the topics that seems to come up frequently, not only on the BSD boards, but Linux, as well, is why a particular OS doesn&amp;rsquo;t support a particular device (wireless, printer, whatever) or piece of software.  There are folks that seem to think that Adobe ought to be available on Linux. Or Microsoft Office.  Or whatever specific piece of software they want.  And it&amp;rsquo;s a whine that I don&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the complaints I&amp;rsquo;ve read about FreeBSD is that it lacks certain &amp;ldquo;vital&amp;rdquo; pieces of software.  Of course what is &amp;ldquo;vital&amp;rdquo; to you may not be vital to me, so that whole complaint is a bit subjective. But, from what I&amp;rsquo;ve read there are some 28,000 programs available for FreeBSD.  Surely there&amp;rsquo;s a program in that bunch that will meet your needs.  Now, I admit that my needs are not that big, but I have had no problem locating and installing every application I need to do my daily work in either the packages or ports for FreeBSD. Scanning the ports lists, I am absolutely astonished at the wide range of applications that are available, including quite a few that I would consider rather arcane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the same complaint levied against various Linux distributions, along with complaints of difficulty in installing them.  These complaints generally come, it seems to me, from folks that are trying to move from Windows to Linux and expecting the exact same experience.  Reminds me of those House Hunter International folks that move from the US to Lithuania for the &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo; then complain that housing in Vilnius (the capital of Lithuania) is not the same as in the US.  The kitchen is smaller, the rooms are smaller, there is no oven, there&amp;rsquo;s no expansive yard, etc.  When you move to a different country, you should expect significant differences in how the people in your new home live and what conveniences are available.  That&amp;rsquo;s the experience you came to have. When you move to a different OS you should expect differences in how the systems work and what software is available.  If there were no differences then there would be no reason to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that kind of brings me back to my topic. If you&amp;rsquo;re wanting to get work done, you choose the best tool for the job.  You might be able to drive a nail in with a screwdriver, but it won&amp;rsquo;t be easy and it won&amp;rsquo;t be pretty.  You might be able to get your work done in Linux, but if your work relies on some specific software which is not available in Linux, then Linux is not the best tool for the job.  Stick with Windows.  Don&amp;rsquo;t whine that the Windows-only application &amp;ldquo;W&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is not available in Linux.  Stick with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you&amp;rsquo;re curious about Linux and want to see what applications are available or what Linux (or BSD) applications might be acceptable alternatives to Windows applications, by all means install and explore Linux (or BSD). Take your time. Explore widely and deeply.  You might just find that there is an alternative that is as good as, and perhaps better than, the Windows version.  Then you can jump out of Windows and into something more interesting, more challenging, and more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Driving a Hybrid Pickup Truck</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;driving-a-hybrid-pickup-truck&#34;&gt;Driving a Hybrid Pickup Truck&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drove a 2000 Ford Ranger for over 20 years.  I loved that truck and basically just wore it out.  I think when I finally sold it in 2021 I had put over 250K miles on it.  But, alas, all good things come to an end and as it got longer in the tooth it began to have more problems, with their associated costs, than I was willing to deal with.  So, having two other vehicles in our house I decided to sell my favorite vehicle of all time. For two years, then, I did not have a truck and, by and large, didn&amp;rsquo;t find that I needed one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;driving-a-hybrid-pickup-truck&#34;&gt;Driving a Hybrid Pickup Truck&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drove a 2000 Ford Ranger for over 20 years.  I loved that truck and basically just wore it out.  I think when I finally sold it in 2021 I had put over 250K miles on it.  But, alas, all good things come to an end and as it got longer in the tooth it began to have more problems, with their associated costs, than I was willing to deal with.  So, having two other vehicles in our house I decided to sell my favorite vehicle of all time. For two years, then, I did not have a truck and, by and large, didn&amp;rsquo;t find that I needed one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we moved.  And our new house had lots of work to be done in the yard.  Now, we have an open trailer that can be used for hauling things, and we turned to it quite a bit but sometimes the trailer seemed overkill for what we needed to haul.  A truck would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, working from home for the last ten years meant that I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of driving anyway and when my wife retired and we were both at home, having two cars just seemed redundant and an unnecessary cost.  I mean I was putting only about 3K miles on my car every year. So, I sold my second car. And we got along okay for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with my wife on the road more to visit family (being retired gave her more time to do those sorts of things) I often found myself at home with no means for getting about.  I needed a car.  And, since we were still doing quite a bit of work in the yard, a truck made sense.  So, truck shopping we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first choice, of course, was another Ranger.  But they&amp;rsquo;ve grown up a bit over time.  For what I needed they seemed to be overkill.  Then I found the Maverick.  Great reviews, perfect size for my needs. And, a bit challenging to get at the time (October 2023). But I happened across a brand new Maverick Hybrid.  Hybrid technologies had intrigued me for quite some time.  I liked the idea of higher MPG as the vehicle switches between the gas engine and electric motors.  The downside, of course, is that the hauling capacity is slightly lower, but given that I rarely haul more than a few hundred pounds that would not likely be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I ponied up a bit more money for what I hope will be lower overall operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that has absolutely fascinated me is the smooth transition between the electric motor and the gas engine.  Unless I&amp;rsquo;m pay really close attention to the sounds of the vehicle, or am looking at the dashboard that shows when the vehicle is in electric mode, I cannot tell when the engine kicks in or when it drops back to the electric motor.  How does it do that? I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; heard the engine actually crank, as it always starts in electric mode and transitions when it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I did a bit of digging to learn how it can make that transition so seamlessly.  I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woBvHw4VYGE&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; really interesting video and learned a lot about the eCVT transmission and the electric motor aspects of vehicle along with the whole regenerative braking thing that recharges the Lithium Ion battery.  From another site (which I don&amp;rsquo;t remember) I learned that the computer in hybrid engines monitor the crankshaft position so that the pistons are positioned to provide optimal conditions for starting.  From what I understand the  eCVT simply transfers power from the wheels to the engine, causing it to turn the crankshaft which, in turn, starts the engine running .  No starter is really even needed!  It&amp;rsquo;s actually a pretty ingenious design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do I like the truck after 4500 miles?  I mostly love it.  I wish the bed was a bit bigger (4.5 feet just doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite allow from carrying some things). And the backseat is a bit tight, though my 11 year old grand daughter has no problem with it.  Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;m happy with my purchase. It is a comfortable drive (though I do miss sitting up a bit higher as you do in most pickups) and handles well.  And my latest fill-up showed 40.5 MPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I sometimes wish I had bought the Ranger?  Sure, but mostly for nostalgia rather than any practical reason.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;doing-unix-y-things&#34;&gt;Doing Unix-y Things&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/my-history-with-self-hosting/&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; I noted that my foray into Linux began when I started an intensive program in network administration, etc  back in 2000.  That&amp;rsquo;s not precisely true.  That course did not teach me &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; about Linux.  I don&amp;rsquo;t even recall it being mentioned.  What it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; teach me was Unix.  Sun Solaris Unix, to be precise, running on a Sun Sparc server (rest their souls). Linux came along a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; teach me was Unix.  Sun Solaris Unix, to be precise, running on a Sun Sparc server (rest their souls). Linux came along a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember, even today, our introduction to the commandline.  I don&amp;rsquo;t really know why, but that black screen, devoid of anything other than a dollar sign and a blinking cursor reminded me of some bottomless pit.  It seemed the whole internet universe was opened up and I was staring into the abyss.  It was a weird feeling.  And, I got over it pretty quick. And I wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that I was intrigued by Unix. The problem was Unix at that time was not cheap and required specific &amp;ndash; and expensive &amp;ndash; hardware. Now a couple of my classmates were rather competent at the commandline and introduced (I should say re-introduced) me to Linux. Unlike that time around 1995 when I got a Linux disk in some PC magazine, popped the floppy disk into the drive, fired up the computer and stared at a blank screen with no idea what to do next, this time I had some inkling of what to do at the commandline. In fact, I felt fairly confident in those unix-y things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for the next twenty or so years I&amp;rsquo;ve bounced around the Linux world trying out various distros, figuring out how to do what I wanted to do, and how to make things happen.  I&amp;rsquo;ve said a lot of bad words along the way and threw more than one item across the room in frustration. But I learned. And I continue to learn.  Sometimes I amaze myself at how much I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. Am I an expert&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;? Not by any means. but, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty damn confident in getting things done, or at least knowing where to look to get the answers. All that said, in truth, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly stumbled through my efforts to get a handle on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I revisited an old friend. Unix.  In the form of FreeBSD.  Now, to be legal, I must say that FreeBSD is not Unix.  It is Unix-like.  Why? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opengroup.org/&#34;&gt;The Open Group&lt;/a&gt; owns the trademark to Unix. They set the standards and provide certification for Unix systems and, therefore, they get to say which systems can call themselves Unix. Systems, such as FreeBSD, which function almost identically to Unix (and that pretty much include Linux, too, I suppose) may say they&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;Unix-like&amp;rdquo; but cannot use the actual title of Unix.  Potayto, potahto, in my view. I imagine there&amp;rsquo;s some serious money mixed in there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSD experience is both quite familiar and quite different from the Linux experience.  It&amp;rsquo;s familiar because much of the work is done at the commandline and the commands are generally the same.  On the other hand, there are generally fewer problems with getting software to work in BSD because the entire system is designed to work cohesively.  There&amp;rsquo;s a handful of programmers that oversee the entire process and only software packages that are fully compliant with the overall design find their way into the ecosystem. BSD systems (yes, there are several) each have specific philosophical approaches and they adhere quite tightly to those approaches.  In short, they don&amp;rsquo;t try to be everything to everybody. They try to tailor their systems to the needs of specific groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because BSDs are more focused, their individual markets are smaller which, in turn, means that fewer programs tend to be developed for a given system.  And this is where BSD really diverges from Linux.  Linux, being a more generalized system, and having thousands more users, has literally thousands of applications&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that will run on that platform (though not without significant issues at times, it must be noted).  And part of that is the draw of Linux. Versatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux powers a lot of servers on the internet.  So does Unix.  In fact, some of the pretty big names on the internet, such as Netflix, use FreeBSD.  The challenge for me is that there are dozens of flavors of Linux, each with their unique take on what is important and how to go about getting things done.  That&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily bad but it does make working on different systems a bit challenging.  And, at least from my point of view, doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, back to the topic at hand.  Why did I decide to revisit Unix?  I wanted to revisit those roots.  I wanted to recall what the true Unix experience is about. I wanted to add to my knowledge base and understanding of operating systems And, I was curious if I could run all the things I&amp;rsquo;m now doing on my linux devices on a BSD system.  The jury is still out on that, by the way, as I&amp;rsquo;m still learning and playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than take a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants, also known as a learn-by-screwing-up, approach I decided to actually take the time to learn, in a more or less systematic manner, the BSD system.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://mwl.io&#34;&gt;Michael W Lucas&lt;/a&gt; has written a great book on FreeBSD called &lt;em&gt;Absolute FreeBSD&lt;/em&gt;.  I have to admit that it is probably the single most easily read and digested tech books I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. And I&amp;rsquo;ve read a bunch of them.  I&amp;rsquo;m only about half-way through the book at this point but already I have a much clearer understanding of a lot of concepts that I was aware of but didn&amp;rsquo;t fully understand.  And, because both FreeBSD and Linux share that common Unix foundation, much (but not all) that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is transferable to the Linux environment.  I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do a book review on this one when I&amp;rsquo;m done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the Unix-y way of doing things.  I like the philosophy that underlies the BSDs. And, I like the knowledge that there are no corporate overlords looking for ways to squeeze more money out of my pocket.  I mean, I read recently that Microsoft is looking at including ads in the start menu. Seriously?  And, I like the fact that the data on my computer, sitting in my office, is confined to my office.  No one is trying to get me to store my data in the cloud (OneDrive, anyone? Oh, and Google, what can I say?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSDs are run by volunteers and not-for-profit organizations rather than corporations.  They are not out to make a gazillion dollars for their stockholders while screwing their customers. And they&amp;rsquo;re not turning their customers into the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I kinda like all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remind me sometime to tell you about my response to the question, &amp;ldquo;do you consider yourself an expert&amp;rdquo; as posed by one of my dissertation professors.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need all those thousands of applications?  How many of them are just tweaks to earlier programs?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Why Do People Use Chromeos</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-do-people-use-chromeos&#34;&gt;Why Do People Use ChromeOS?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like people have jumping on the ChromeOS bandwagon in droves since the first Chromebooks debuted in 2011.  The draw, as I understand it, was that the laptops were small and inexpensive and required little knowledge of computing.  Boot it up, create a Google account (if you didn&amp;rsquo;t already have one), and go.  Schools and even businesses bought into the ecosystem quickly.  Today many schools are almost entirely connected using Chromebooks and often students are given a Chromebook for them to take home and use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-do-people-use-chromeos&#34;&gt;Why Do People Use ChromeOS?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like people have jumping on the ChromeOS bandwagon in droves since the first Chromebooks debuted in 2011.  The draw, as I understand it, was that the laptops were small and inexpensive and required little knowledge of computing.  Boot it up, create a Google account (if you didn&amp;rsquo;t already have one), and go.  Schools and even businesses bought into the ecosystem quickly.  Today many schools are almost entirely connected using Chromebooks and often students are given a Chromebook for them to take home and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;rsquo;t understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back in the day, before personal computers were a thing, computers were generally mainframes that individual users accessed via a dumb terminal or thin client.  Little to no actual processing occurred on the terminal and nothing was stored locally.  According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromeOS&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; this was also the model used for the original ChromeOS &amp;ndash; the laptop was nothing more than a thin client that connected the server using a traditional server-client model.  While that model has evolved over time, the reality is that it is still, by and large, a client-sever model where most of the computing activity and storage occurs.  For a time, Google encouraged developers to create apps that would run on the limited OS. However, that activity has subsided and the move now is to &amp;ldquo;Web Applications&amp;rdquo; where everything is through the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be fair, if a user&amp;rsquo;s primary need for a computer is to surf the web, check email, and write an occasional document, ChromeOS is fine.  Google&amp;rsquo;s office suite is not bad and is, for most people, quite sufficient. Where I start running into problems is with the limitations of web apps, the ridiculous cost of the hardware relative to what it provides, and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk, first, about the hardware.  ChromeOS requires little processing power on the user&amp;rsquo;s end.  Generally speaking, it only needs to generate a webpage. This uses very little processing power.  Even with web apps that are heavily weighed down with JavaScript neither processing power nor memory are issues. Even the most minimal computer should easily be able to handle the load.  Yet, a quick visit to Best Buy shows that Chromebooks range in price from $169 US to $699 US.  Those higher end machines tend to have specs that simply aren&amp;rsquo;t needed for ChromeOS.  What gives?  I mean, do you really need an Intel i5 Ultra processor with 8 GB ram and a 256GB hard drive on a device that does almost all of its work in a browser and saves the results of that work in the cloud?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in fairness, those machines apparently are designed to run not just ChromeOS but to also allow you to run Linux apps on the device, though you have to jump through some hoops to make that happen.  Once upon a time more processing power, more memory, and more storage was a good thing, particularly when using Microsoft Windows.  But that is not really needed with Chrome.  It seems that manufacturers recognized that the &amp;ldquo;more, more, more&amp;rdquo; mindset still influences user&amp;rsquo;s buying decisions and so are building and selling machines that simply don&amp;rsquo;t need that much capacity but which generate more revenue for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern I have with ChromeOS is that all Chrome devices have an expiration date.  That&amp;rsquo;s right.  Depending on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en&#34;&gt;machine&lt;/a&gt; ChromeOS will no longer receive updates for the OS.  That means that, among other things, while Google touts the security benefits of the OS, once that device has expired it will no longer get that benefit. Now, you might argue that Microsoft and Apple do the same thing and, to some degree, that is true.  But if I buy a new Windows computer two months before a new version of the OS comes out, I can generally upgrade my OS to that new version for free and I will then have the same benefits of every other user of the new version.  That has generally been true of Mac, as well, so long as they don&amp;rsquo;t change the actual hardware (e.g. moving from Intel to their own silicon).  But, if I unknowingly buy a Chromebook that expires in three months, well, I&amp;rsquo;m just SOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really see why that is necessary given that you&amp;rsquo;re talking about an OS that runs little more than a web browser.  Just seems very arbitrary to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to another area that I&amp;rsquo;m just scratching my head over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago the school system that my wife worked for moved to Chromebooks.  Their rational was that it was training students in the use of technology so that they are better positioned to transfer those skills into the workforce. Huh?  By far the majority of businesses rely on Microsoft Office products to conduct business.  Microsoft Office does not run on Chromebooks, so are you really teaching students how to be successful in that environment?  And, what about teaching programming?  It ain&amp;rsquo;t happening on a Chromebook!  The OS simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide the environment for proper programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important, too, to remember that everything you do on a Chromebook is sent to Google.  All of your Documents are stored in their cloud.  While they &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; to be a highly secure environment, &lt;a href=&#34;../i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure&lt;/a&gt;.  Do you really want your financials and health information stored on Google&amp;rsquo;s servers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, stop and think about this for just a minute.  You buy, let&amp;rsquo;s say, that $169 chromebook from Best Buy, you create a google account and then begin using their OS and their storage for all their documents.  According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/chromebook-plus-education/#:~:text=Chromebooks%20are%20used%20by%2050,research%20centers%20and%20collaboration%20hubs.&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; some 50 MILLION students use chromebooks.  That is a TON of storage and a TON of bandwidth that is needed to support those users. And that doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the millions of other business  and individual users.  And yet, there is no cost for that service. No business is going to give away that much of their resources for free.  So, how does Google benefit from this?  I don&amp;rsquo;t have a definitive answer but I have my suspicions. And I&amp;rsquo;ll bet they&amp;rsquo;re the same as yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I come back to, &amp;ldquo;why do people use ChromeOS&amp;rdquo;.  I tried it briefly but didn&amp;rsquo;t find it terribly useful so, for me, I&amp;rsquo;ll stick with my Mac, Linux, and BSD machines where I can actually do what I want to do, my way (generally) without the arbitrary limitations of web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving from Exchange to Zoho Mail</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/moving-from-exchange-to-zoho-mail/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/moving-from-exchange-to-zoho-mail/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;moving-from-exchange-to-zoho-mail&#34;&gt;Moving from Exchange to Zoho Mail&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere back around 2011 or 2012 I moved from my ISP&amp;rsquo;s email service to Microsoft Office 365 Business plan that offered access to MS Exchange server.  I had previously toyed with using Gmail&amp;rsquo;s services with my own domain name but didn&amp;rsquo;t find that it met my specific needs.  Too, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t have a great love for Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My motivation for moving, as I recall now more than a dozen years later, is that I was starting my doctoral studies and needed to be able to coordinate more easily with classmates, access calendars and documents across multiple platforms, and generally have better control over my workflows.  I was already using Microsoft Office for my word processing and spreadsheet needs, and was looking for an integrated solution that would allow me to plan and execute my work more easily.  After playing around with several solutions I finally settled on Office 365.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Too, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t have a great love for Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My motivation for moving, as I recall now more than a dozen years later, is that I was starting my doctoral studies and needed to be able to coordinate more easily with classmates, access calendars and documents across multiple platforms, and generally have better control over my workflows.  I was already using Microsoft Office for my word processing and spreadsheet needs, and was looking for an integrated solution that would allow me to plan and execute my work more easily.  After playing around with several solutions I finally settled on Office 365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks might argue that using Gmail&amp;rsquo;s free service (which at the time allowed the use of personal domain name without incurring an additional cost) made more sense than spending money on O365.  I saw it differently.  First, there&amp;rsquo;s the old mantra that if it&amp;rsquo;s free then you&amp;rsquo;re the product and there was some question (at least in my mind) about the security and privacy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why/&#34;&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt;.  An issue that I still feel is valid today.  Second, I was already using MS Word for my writing and rather than write in Google Docs then convert to .docx, it made more sense to use MS Word and save my documents to the Sharepoint site that was included in my O365 account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I was not terribly keen on paying upwards of $60 a year for email but when I took a step back, I realized that the benefits I got from using O365 made the cost at least reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s fast-forward to 2024.  I completed my doctorate in 2018. With the degree behind me and my employer providing an O365 account for most of my work, I no longer really needed my personal O365 account.  Inertia, more than anything else, kept me from switching away.  I had thousands of emails tucked away in my email account and several hundred documents stored in Sharepoint.  Moving all of that stuff was, it seemed, a daunting task.  So, I just let it sit and paid the annual costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, 2023, though, I retired and started taking a good look at what I was using.  I realized pretty quickly that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using essentially any of the services offered by O365 beyond email and that was mostly junk mail.  Why was I paying $60/ year for that service?  Beside, over time the offerings that came with what was initially called &amp;ldquo;Business Essentials&amp;rdquo; were degraded with fewer and fewer services offered at that tier.  The cost/benefit just wasn&amp;rsquo;t there. So, I began looking for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the considerations was the amount of available storage for emails and attachments. I took a look at my O365 mail storage usage and realized that I had accumulated less than 1.5 GB of email storage over a  10 year period.  I knew that even a small storage application would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at a variety of services, including some very popular, privacy oriented services such as ProtonMail, GMX, Mail.com, and several others. Overall, the costs for these services were not that much different from what I was already paying and the didn&amp;rsquo;t provide the same benefits as O365 so there was really no incentive to move to any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even considered simply using my extant iCloud+ account which allows you to include a custom domain for your email.  Since I was already paying for iCloud+ that would have seemed the logical choice.  The issue there is that your &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:me@icloud.com&#34;&gt;me@icloud.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:me@me.com&#34;&gt;me@me.com&lt;/a&gt;, and your custom domain email all get dumped into one pot.  I use my iCloud email as something of a filter when I need to sign up or provide an email address for a service or site that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I trust.  This way my legitimate mail and my &amp;lsquo;junk&amp;rsquo; email has a bit of separation.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t want everything dumped in one bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing a bit more research, I found Zoho Mail. Doing a bit of research, I found that Zoho has been around since 1996, is based in India, has several locations around the world, including Texas in the US, and has a full suite of business applications.  As of 2022, it had more than 80 million users, including some big names like Amazon, Netflix, Nike, etc &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  This was not fly-by-night operation that was likely to go belly-up anytime soon and, moreover, has demonstrated that it is a trustworthy operation in terms of security. Now the site is, to me, a bit confusing. But for a mere $1.25 (that&amp;rsquo;s a dollar and a quarter!) a month you get full business level email with 10GB storage, well beyond my needs for the foreseeable future.  From everything I can find out, it is as secure as O365.  I made my decision!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I was dreading was moving from one service to another.  However, Zoho provides a process for doing that which is simple and works fairly quickly.  Overall the process took maybe an hour to complete and when it was done I had all of my emails from my O365 account now in my Zohomail account, and was appropriately accessing the account using my custom domain name&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  I waited a few weeks before deactivating my O365 account. This allowed me to ensure that everything was working as it should be and that I had downloaded from my Sharepoint site all that I wanted and deleted the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;rsquo;m quite satisfied with Zoho as my mail provider.  The service is responsive, secure, does a good job of filtering spam and even sorts mail into various buckets e.g. newsletters, notifications, etc. My email clients have no problems connecting to the service and I&amp;rsquo;ve had not issues with mail I send being rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have to update my DNS records with my registrar in order to use my custom domain with my new email provider.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My History with Self Hosting</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-history-with-self-hosting&#34;&gt;My History with Self-Hosting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey with Linux started in the summer of 2020 when I enrolled in an intensive course in IT designed for a specific ISP (which no longer exists). The course was provide through a state university in cooperation with that company and in conjunction with a state level push to encourage&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; tech companies to settle in Georgia.  I ended up not taking a job with that company. While was at the top of my class, the company decided not to extend an employment offer to me and so I moved on.  In retrospect, I think that was probably a good decision and the guys that were in the class with me all left that company and, honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where most of them landed.  Despite that, the class was still one of the most exciting and fulfilling experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had. And, I left it with fairly sound skillsets in networking, programming (C and Perl, primarily), web development and graphics (which I still suck at).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-history-with-self-hosting&#34;&gt;My History with Self-Hosting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey with Linux started in the summer of 2020 when I enrolled in an intensive course in IT designed for a specific ISP (which no longer exists). The course was provide through a state university in cooperation with that company and in conjunction with a state level push to encourage&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; tech companies to settle in Georgia.

And, I left it with fairly sound skillsets in networking, programming (C and Perl, primarily), web development and graphics (which I still suck at).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the intervening 24 years I&amp;rsquo;ve played with a lot of Linux computers and done a lot of interesting things. It was very shortly after completing that program that I begin self-hosting.  In those early days most of the sites where of the CMS variety &amp;ndash; Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla, MediaWiki, Dokuwiki, PHP-Fusion, PHP-Nuke, and the list goes on.  The challenge was that most of these required direct installation which almost invariably led to hours of trying to sort out the failed dependencies, troubleshoot a ton of issues and, in the end, nuking all that work for one reason or another.  While I absolutely loved learning about these different systems and enjoyed the challenge, in the end I really found that most of them were simply overkill for what I needed.  So, why did I do it?  Because I was curious about what made each system different and found the challenge itself fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;down-the-self-hosting-rabbit-hole&#34;&gt;Down the Self-Hosting Rabbit Hole&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last five or so years, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved in different directions.  Rather than manually installing all of these different systems, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved toward newer technologies that make the process easier and allow me to try different things to find what works best for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;yunohost-and-sandstorm&#34;&gt;Yunohost and Sandstorm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the earliest packaged system was something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://yunohost.org&#34;&gt;Yunohost&lt;/a&gt;. According to their website, Yunohost was created in 2012.  I probably installed my first version of it around 2014 or 2015 when I first starting futzing around with the Raspberry Pi. Yunohost, it seemed, was the perfect pairing to the RPI.  Along about the same time, I looked at &lt;a href=&#34;https://sandstorm.io&#34;&gt;Sandstorm&lt;/a&gt; which debuted in 2014. Both products do similar things &amp;ndash; making it easy to install web server apps on your local system.  Both had extensive app lists from which you could choose. The cool thing about both of these was that you were able to fairly easily install an app, see how it worked, see what uses you might have for it and, if it didn&amp;rsquo;t excite you, easily blow it away.  The downside, of course, is there were fewer problems with the installs which eliminated some of the &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; of learning and installing software 😀.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ansible-nas&#34;&gt;Ansible-NAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time I&amp;rsquo;ve expanded my computer stable from one desktop, one laptop, one server, and a couple of RPIs, to about a half dozen servers. This gave me the opportunity to muck around with Linux Desktop and to use &amp;ldquo;development&amp;rdquo; servers for play while not really disrupting the installations that I actually used.   As I did this I ran across another intriguing process option &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ansible-nas.io&#34;&gt;Ansible NAS&lt;/a&gt; by David Stephens.  Whereas Yunohost and Sandstorm provided a GUI that allowed you to see the list of available apps and descriptions of what the apps did, Ansible-NAS used an Ansible script to set up your server and install the desired applications. To use it, you needed to learn a bit about YAML and how to edit Ansible scripts. I was back in my element of having to learn and figure crap out to make it work!  I loved Ansible-NAS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through mucking around with Ansible-NAS I started learning bits and piece of ansible.  Many of the scripts used in Ansible-NAS were based on work by Jeff Geerling, a fellow with a rather interesting resume.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeffgeerling.com&#34;&gt;GeerlingGuy&lt;/a&gt; authored a book on Ansible that I&amp;rsquo;ve only fairly recently starting studying.  I also follow his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@JeffGeerling&#34;&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; as he does quite a bit with the Raspberry pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;then-came-docker&#34;&gt;Then came Docker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thirst to learn more, though, led me to Docker.  My early efforts with this technology was somewhat &amp;hellip; challenging.  I spent some time learning how to create docker-compose files and explored DockerHub but overall found the experience more confusing than anything else. Maybe that was because, as I recall, Docker didn&amp;rsquo;t work well on the RPI at the time which was the only linux device I had available and Docker basically sucked on Windows and Mac (at least that&amp;rsquo;s as I recall it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the early setback with Docker, I persisted and today I have somewhere in the neighborhood of two dozen docker containers running on two servers.  These containers provide everything from monitoring my IP cameras, to a Wordpress blog, a photography site, Calibre-web, my cloudflared instance, Jellyfin, and a host of other useful applications. The advent of management systems such as Portainer made managing the docker containers easier and accelerated my implementation of applications in Docker. Not all of the applications I use are in docker containers, however.  As I continued to play around with these newer technologies I ran into two other products that I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like: ProxMox and Unraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proxmox-and-unraid-arrive-on-the-scene&#34;&gt;Proxmox and Unraid Arrive on the Scene&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Proxmox] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://proxmox.com/en/&#34;&gt;https://proxmox.com/en/&lt;/a&gt;) was first on the scene for me.  I was intrigued by an OS that provided an overarching management structure for creating virtual machines, LXC containers, and general NAS type storage. In fact, while I had played with virtual machines for years through VirtualBox and VMWare, that was all done on my desktop system and while VMs were great for testing and playing with various distributions, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see a lot of utility for daily use.  Proxmox, though, suddenly made the creation of VMs not only easy but quite useful. All of my docker containers running on the Proxmox box are running inside a VM.  When I&amp;rsquo;m learning something new, or testing out an new OS or whatever, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to spin up a VM knowing that if I bork it, well, I just delete that VM and start over. No harm, no foul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was delving into Proxmox, I also ran across &lt;a href=&#34;https://unraid.net&#34;&gt;Unraid&lt;/a&gt;.  Unraid provides similar functionality to Proxmox with a few differences.  There are three primary differences between the two products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First is that while Proxmox is open source and free to use, Unraid has a free trial but does require a purchase in order to continue using the product past the trial period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, Unraid runs from a thumbdrive rather than from a hard drive.  As I understand it, once loaded, there is little to no activity on the boot disk (thumbdrive) so the thumbdrive allows you to use all of your storage disks for data rather than dedicating some or all of a drive to the OS.  That&amp;rsquo;s a nice feature!  And, because my HP Microserver has an internal USB port, I can use that for my boot disk and don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it being dislodged or lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, Unraid provides a host of applications that have presumably been optimized for the Unraid system that can generally be installed with a single click.  I believe that all of these apps are docker images, though I cannot be sure of that. Unraid also provides a variety of plugins that can be accessed from the web GUI.  If Proxmox has a similar feature, I haven&amp;rsquo;t found it. (But, then again, I also haven&amp;rsquo;t had a need for plugins, either.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stand now, I have two machines,  an HP Gen10 Plus Microserver and a repurposed HP EliteDesk, acting as servers on my network.  The HP hosts the Unraid server and the EliteDesk hosts the Proxmox server.  Yes, I could probably consolidate everything onto one server. And, yes, it might be wiser to run Proxmox on one machine and have a second Proxmox as a backup / fallback device.  But for now, I&amp;rsquo;m happy with my current setup and they allow me some choice in where applications are hosted and expand my storage capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-running-where&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Running, Where?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxmox:
LXCs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adguard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;motioneye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shaarli&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vaultwarden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wireguard (shut down at the moment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;omada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bookstack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tillium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dokuwiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tailscale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QEMU (VMs):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu server &amp;ndash; docker server with these containers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calibre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calibre-web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cloudflared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flame (a dashboard)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jellyfin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;joplin sync server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KIWIX (this is a cool off-line Wikipedia and other server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navidrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;portainer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uptime-kuma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wallabag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are QEMUs but are generaly turned off unless I have specific need for them:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Unraid server:
VMS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spin up vms here as needed when I&amp;rsquo;m exploring something that does not have a docker image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker containers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agent-DVR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apacheGuacamole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calibre (testing version)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calibre-web (testing version)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excalidraw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freshrss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gitea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grav (local version of this website)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homebridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MariaDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB (used for testing and will likely be nuked)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;phpmyadmin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;postgres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;raneto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shinobi-pro-cctv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StirlingPDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;webtop (toying with this one for now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wekan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wordpress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see I muck around with a lot of stuff. And I&amp;rsquo;m still looking, exploring and adding new stuff along the way.  The one advantage (?) of Unraid is that the App store makes it easy to find new applications to install and explore.  More often than not, I&amp;rsquo;ll install something, play with it a bit, then delete it, but sometimes I find something new and useful that becomes part of my everyday workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I say?  I love playing with technology!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PlainText Preferences</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/plaintext-preference/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/plaintext-preference/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;plaintext-preferences&#34;&gt;PlainText Preferences&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last ten years there have been a couple of preferences that have driven many of my technology decisions.  One is a preference for using plain text rather than proprietary software. The other is a preference for flat files over databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-talk-about-plain-text&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk about Plain Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My move toward plain text came about for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I just wanted to take notes that I could quickly create and reference as needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;plaintext-preferences&#34;&gt;PlainText Preferences&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last ten years there have been a couple of preferences that have driven many of my technology decisions.  One is a preference for using plain text rather than proprietary software. The other is a preference for flat files over databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-talk-about-plain-text&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk about Plain Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My move toward plain text came about for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I just wanted to take notes that I could quickly create and reference as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I  wanted to be able to focus on writing, such as an essay or blog post, without worrying really about formatting, etc.  What more distraction-free writing environment is there than the command line?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I wanted small, easily accessed files.  None of the proprietary word processors come close to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, I wanted to be able to do access and edit the files on any device I happen to be on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, I wanted them to be available 20 years from now (why I&amp;rsquo;ll still need them at age 85, who knows, but still &amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that all may sound nice, you say, but is it really practical?  I think so, particularly with the advent of Markdown.  Markdown allows me to provide some basic formatting as I write (think section headings) while minimizing the cruft.  The fact is, if I need to put a document into a particular format, let&amp;rsquo;s say Microsoft Word, I just need to copy and paste the plain text into the word processor and I&amp;rsquo;m off to the races.  On the other hand, trying to get a clean copy of that document &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of Word &amp;hellip; well, good luck with that.  The point is I can use &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; processing software to pretty up my work while keeping a clean copy available for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;and-then-there-are-flat-files&#34;&gt;And Then There Are Flat Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely allied with plain text files is the use of flat files.  I have come to prefer flat files for pretty much the same reason I like plain text &amp;ndash; easy of access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, full disclosure, I spent quite a bit of time over the last 24 years learning databases. I have created and managed many, many databases over that time and absolutely have nothing against them, per se. In the right environment and the right data they are phenomenal and, of course, are the best choice.  For my personal needs, though, databases seem to be overkill.  The right tool for the right job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing data in a database is very useful with large datasets.  In fact, it is really about the only way to work with very large datasets.  Storing my writing in a database, though, poses several issues. The first, obviously, is that the use of a database program to store a file makes little sense.  It adds an unnecessary level of complexity and creates an opportunity for failure.  More importantly, if the database should become corrupted the I lose all of my work.  Not an appetizing prospect.  Again, given the small quantity of work I do, the complexity and bulk of a database is simply overkill.  Running a database to store even one hundred blog posts is more work than needed.  To me, though, the most important reason is that to get my work out of the database requires a lot of extra effort.  If, for example,  I decide to move to a different computer, or a different web server, or use a different blogging platform, transitioning from one database system to another is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat files allow me to bypass that complexity and have everything I need easily available.  The order of the day, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already guessed is to minimize friction in my workflow.  The less complex, the better.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t get much simpler than a simple plain text file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my current workflow is to use Obsidian to write my notes, blog posts, etc. Obsidian saves all my files as simple flat files in plain text.  I copy those files over to my web folder where I run my Static Site Generator&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to create my website, then rsync those files up to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of evaluating which SSG to use.  I want my website to be static, as well with minimal extra stuff (think &lt;a href=&#34;https://brutalist-web.design&#34;&gt;Brutalist Web Design&lt;/a&gt;) so I&amp;rsquo;m looking around to see what fits me best.  I&amp;rsquo;m leaning toward either Hugo or MkDocs right now. But that is subject to change!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/my-wife-always-wanted-to-marry-a-pilot/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-wife-always-wanted-to-marry-a-pilot&#34;&gt;My Wife Always Wanted to Marry a Pilot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-bit-of-background&#34;&gt;A Bit of Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became interested in drones in the spring of 2021.  My wife was preparing to retire from her teaching gig and considering a new career in real estate.  After 15 years in our relatively small town in the mountains of North Georgia, we were planning a move to a little larger town with fewer challenging hills and more conveniences. We were building a new home in our soon-to-be new town.  This was, I thought, a great time &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;to explore my interest in drones.  After all, I could document the progress of our new home and, if she did go into real estate, I would be positioned to do some of her photography.  Win!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I became interested in drones in the spring of 2021.  My wife was preparing to retire from her teaching gig and considering a new career in real estate.  After 15 years in our relatively small town in the mountains of North Georgia, we were planning a move to a little larger town with fewer challenging hills and more conveniences. We were building a new home in our soon-to-be new town.  This was, I thought, a great time &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;to explore my interest in drones.  After all, I could document the progress of our new home and, if she did go into real estate, I would be positioned to do some of her photography.  Win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, while you can fly your drone recreationally without needing a license, if you do anything that has the potential for profit, the FAA requires that you hold a license as a professional drone pilot. The fancy pants way of describing this is that you must hold an Airman certificate for small unmanned aircraft systems, more colloquially this is known as being Part 107 certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were pursuing a private pilot license to fly a manned aircraft (for example, a Piper Cub) you would have to go through some fairly rigorous ground school training, learn a ton about weather, radio lingo, how to navigate between airports (and around an airport) and so on. After completing ground school you have to spend time actually flying an aircraft under the direct tutelage of a qualified instructor before being allowed to solo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison to the manned aircraft certificate, the process for obtaining your unmanned certificate (Part 107) is a bit easier.  You only need to take certain topics from the ground school and pass a knowledge test.  No actual flight time required.  The requirements for the test are laid out for you in the &lt;em&gt;Remote Pilot &amp;ndash; Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Study Guide (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;opi=89978449&amp;amp;url=https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/remote_pilot_study_guide.pdf&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiwuJ33u-eFAxWErIQIHU7lBIUQFnoECAYQAQ&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3MXKA-tW2dc0bYz-JcA9Qh&#34;&gt;FAA-G-8082-22&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; provided by the FAA.  This study guide is fairly comprehensible, but sometimes simply reading the content isn&amp;rsquo;t enough.  I like to see and hear what I&amp;rsquo;m learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to make life a bit easier (and easier to understand) I opted to take a paid course to prepare me for the exam.  The cost of theses programs vary considerably and, so far as I know, unlike private pilot training, the FAA does not certify programs that prepare you for the exam. I chose one that seemed reasonable in cost and had good reviews: Pilot Institute. And started studying in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually went through the entire training in a few weeks and was ready to take the test. During the interim, however, my wife decided that she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pursue real estate as a second career and with that motivation gone, I decided not to continue my pursuit of the license.  After all, why pay for testing for a license that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t likely ever use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-renewed-motivation&#34;&gt;A Renewed Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a couple of years.  As I prepared for my own retirement, I began looking at my next chapter. I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed writing and thought that I might get serious about blogging regularly.  To add to that, I was fascinated by videography and realized that I could actually make videos that included drone shots.  Motivation for obtaining my license was renewed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that renewed motivation I again studied in earnest. In fact, I went through the material in about a week or 10 days. I found the information fun and interesting.  There are several areas that I want to dig into a bit more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-do-you-need-a-license&#34;&gt;Why do you need a license?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, it seems like the need for a license is just a &amp;lsquo;control&amp;rsquo; thing.  The reality is that the FAA is concerned about safety &amp;ndash; for you and the general public.  The license ensures that you are flying in a safe manner and understand what is needed to protect yourself and those around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;so-what-is-in-the-exam&#34;&gt;So, what is in the exam?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious, and most applicable, is information on the actual regulations that govern the use of sUAS (small Unmanned Aircraft Systems).  Other information I thought was pretty interesting, but much less useful.  For example, in general you&amp;rsquo;re not permitted to fly your UAS at an airport, yet the exam includes questions about the signage on runways and taxiways.  Similarly, do I really need to know how to enter a landing pattern for an airport?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be fair, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; radio controlled aircraft are considered drones or UASs.  This would include all radio controlled fixed wing model aircraft, so there is some potential applicability for this information.  But to require that knowledge on a licensing exam seems a bit over the top.  The more I studied and considered the exam, the more I began to think that perhaps the FAA felt they needed some type of licensing but didn&amp;rsquo;t really have anything to test on, so they included material that was only tangentially relevant to most drone pilots. And, to be honest, I did find the information interesting and piqued my interest to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-whats-on-the-test&#34;&gt;So, What&amp;rsquo;s on the Test?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I alluded to some of the general concepts above. More specifically, the test covers five areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airspace and Requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loading and Performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of those areas are broken down into submodules so that the overall test covers a dozen topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicable regulations relating to small unmanned aircraft system rating privileges, limitations, and flight operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airspace classification and operating requirements, and flight restrictions affecting small unmanned aircraft operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aviation weather sources and effects of weather on small unmanned aircraft performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small unmanned aircraft loading and performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emergency procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crew resource management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio communication procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determining the performance of small unmanned aircraft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physiological effects of drugs and alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aeronautical decision-making and judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airport operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintenance and pre-flight inspection procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;taking-the-exam&#34;&gt;Taking the Exam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve studied and feel prepared to take the exam, you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an account on the FAA&amp;rsquo;s Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA) website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve created your account, you&amp;rsquo;re assigned an FAA Tracking Number (FTN). This number stays with you throughout your aviation career and allows the FAA to keep all of your records together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With your FTN in hand, you then go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://faa.psiexams.com/faa/login&#34;&gt;Testing Center Website&lt;/a&gt; where you create yet another account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve created that account you simply look for testing centers that are near you. One of the challenges I ran into is that the information on testing sites is a bit confusing at first.  I found several testing sites near me that I would have preferred but couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to register.  What I discovered is that those sites, while official testing sites, either had no availability or were simply not accepting reservations.  Scrolling a bit further down the page I finally found some (relatively) nearby sites that had availability.  My closest one was about an hour away.  Chose a time and date and I was set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived about 30 minutes before my exam. One other person was there waiting to take the exam, as well.  I strongly encourage you to arrive early if for no other reason than to gather your wits about yourself before testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testing site was quite nice and the people were great.  They check you in, verify your identity and explain the process to you.  You do have to give up anything that&amp;rsquo;s in your pockets (wallet, phone, keys, etc) to ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re not cheating.  They also have cameras and a proctor watching, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel intimidated by any of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;re assigned a computer and test code, you go through a brief training program on the computer and, when you&amp;rsquo;re ready, you click start and away you go!  You&amp;rsquo;re given two hours to complete the exam. I took about an hour and that included double-checking every answer.  Most of the answers I knew right off &amp;ndash; my training was quite effective.  There were a few answers that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about and one that I had absolutely no clue. The other guy that was there started about 5 minutes or so before me and was still there when I left.  I have no clue how he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One odd thing about the testing software: Once you complete all of the questions it returns you to the first question. I assume that is to allow you to review your answers before submitting.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly clear, though, how to exit that cycle and actually submit the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve completed the exam and clicked submit you&amp;rsquo;re taken to a survey.  Once the survey is completed the software closes and you&amp;rsquo;re directed back to the proctor&amp;rsquo;s office for your score.  I made a 92!  The score report does provide feedback on the areas you missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you&amp;rsquo;re not done yet!  With your score in hand, you go back to the IACRA website to submit your application for a license. You need your Exam ID number that is assigned when you complete the test in order to apply for your license. This ties your score to you in the IACRA system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, within a few days you&amp;rsquo;ll receive an email that includes your temporary airman certificate that indicates that you&amp;rsquo;re a remote pilot of small unmanned aircraft systems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet received my permanent certificate, but it should be coming in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-you-need-to-renew-your-license&#34;&gt;Do You Need to Renew your License?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, every two years you&amp;rsquo;ll need to renew your license.  Once upon a time (before 2021) you needed to re-test in order to renew your license.  The rule has changed and now you simply need to take an online refresher course (provided by the FAA). You&amp;rsquo;ll then receive a certificate showing the completion of the course and you&amp;rsquo;re good for another 24 calendar months.  One note, though, just as you&amp;rsquo;ll need to have you Part 107 license on you when you fly, you will also need to keep a copy of the certificate of completion on you to demonstrate compliance with the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now my wife can claim to be the wife of a pilot!  (that was her idea, not mine.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Don&#39;t Trust Gmail. Here&#39;s Why</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why&#34;&gt;I Don&amp;rsquo;t Trust Gmail. Here&amp;rsquo;s Why.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had an email address with Gmail for probably 20 years.  I mean my email address is my name @ Gmail. No numbers, no weird abbreviations, no strange punctuations, just my firstnamelastname @gmail.com How long has it been since that was possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three or four years ago I began receiving emails to my address that were clearly intended for another pers&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;on with my same name.  Their email was literally my email address!  At first I thought it was just an glitch in the system. Later I thought perhaps they had simply mis-typed their name (maybe left out a letter or something) or had made up a name so that they did not get spam emails.  However, many of those emails were for legitimate purposes &amp;ndash; receipts from Tractor Supply or from their cell phone provider.  What gives?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;i-dont-trust-gmail-heres-why&#34;&gt;I Don&amp;rsquo;t Trust Gmail. Here&amp;rsquo;s Why.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had an email address with Gmail for probably 20 years.  I mean my email address is my name @ Gmail. No numbers, no weird abbreviations, no strange punctuations, just my firstnamelastname @gmail.com How long has it been since that was possible?&lt;/p&gt;

However, many of those emails were for legitimate purposes &amp;ndash; receipts from Tractor Supply or from their cell phone provider.  What gives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that there are at least a dozen folks out there here in the US and in South Africa and Australia that share my name.  But Gmail should not allow anyone else to create an account with the same user name.  Yet, clearly, when I look at the emails intended for those other Kevins it is very clear that they are using the same email address.  How is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me, then, that if I am receiving their emails, they are likely seeing some of mine.  Not a good plan!  I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to figure out how to contact Gmail to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on and how this could be happening but so far I haven&amp;rsquo;t been successful.  And, frankly, with so many other email accounts available to me (outlook, yahoo, icloud, etc) I don&amp;rsquo;t really need the Gmail account anymore.  I keep it simply because I&amp;rsquo;ve had it so long and there are still a (very) few folks that only have that address for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t use Gmail for anything embarrassing or nefarious but, still, the idea that others may be receiving emails intended for me is, to say the least unsettling. So, since I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to track down why I am receiving emails intended for others and how it is possible for others to create accounts using my same username (there are at least two!) I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that I can trust Gmail. For that reason I no longer use it for anything other than as an address to use when I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to receive emails to my primary service (I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that in another post).  That&amp;rsquo;s sad, because Gmail used to be a good service.  But, I guess when you get too big for your britches you lose control of a lot of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;nextcloud-onlyoffice-and-the-like&#34;&gt;Nextcloud, OnlyOffice, and the Like&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while I get this notion that I need to move my data off of sites
like Dropbox, OneDrive, and so forth. When I do, I start playing around with
self-hosted services such as NextCloud, OwnCloud, and so forth. I&amp;rsquo;m currently in
one of those cycles and have been playing around a good bit with Nextcloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve even coupled it with OnlyOffice so that I can edit documents in the&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;nextcloud-onlyoffice-and-the-like&#34;&gt;Nextcloud, OnlyOffice, and the Like&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while I get this notion that I need to move my data off of sites
like Dropbox, OneDrive, and so forth. When I do, I start playing around with
self-hosted services such as NextCloud, OwnCloud, and so forth. I&amp;rsquo;m currently in
one of those cycles and have been playing around a good bit with Nextcloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve even coupled it with OnlyOffice so that I can edit documents in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where I am right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-setup&#34;&gt;My Current Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me say upfront that I use OneDrive for most of my document storage. That
came about partly because I use a Microsoft Surface, as well as a Windows laptop
that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a large storage capacity.  Being able to write a document in
Word and send it straight to the cloud service, and then to have that document
available from any computer I work on (I have several) is a great convenience.&lt;br&gt;
Now, it&amp;rsquo;s important, here, to note that I actually have two OneDrive accounts:
The 5 GB free one and a 1 TB paid service through my Office365 account. I
actually use the paid account as my Exchange server more than for file storage,
but that option is available to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my documents, though, are saved to a Linux-based local network file
server. All of my computers are attached to that file server so that I can
access my files from that machine. The OneDrive folder that is synced to to
cloud service actually lives on that local server and is mapped to a drive on my
Windows laptop.  This ensures both that I have local access and have a backup of
those files I consider critical. (They&amp;rsquo;re also backed up locally to another
computer.)  Ensuring that those critical files are backed up off site is
important
and one of the arguments I have against self-hosted &amp;ldquo;cloud services&amp;rdquo;. What is
the point of &amp;ldquo;self-hosting&amp;rdquo; if you&amp;rsquo;re then going to back up those same files to
an online backup service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the arguments that I frequently hear is that these services allow me to
access my files from anywhere. This is true.  And, if I&amp;rsquo;m not on my own computer
( a rare occurrence), this can be a very important, even critical, feature.  In
my case, though, I have all of my mobile devices set to access my local network
through a VPN. My Ubiquiti Edgerouter X made setting up that VPN almost trivial
and works flawlessly.  So, so long as I have one of my mobile devices, I can
access my internal network and all the files available there.  No need for a
webservice to provide that intermediate layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;privacy-concerns&#34;&gt;Privacy Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most of the online discussions surrounding these types of self-hosted
services, the primary reason for moving from a &amp;ldquo;cloud host&amp;rdquo; to a self-hosted
solution is privacy.  After all, we don&amp;rsquo;t want those big, bad companies mining
our files for information.  As I considered this argument, though, I had to come
to the conclusion that it didn&amp;rsquo;t really matter to me.  First of all, there&amp;rsquo;s
really nothing in my files that I feel is so important that it needs to be
secured.  If I have such files (various bills and statements come to mind), I
don&amp;rsquo;t put them in my Dropbox or OneDrive folder.  They live in a local folder.
Most of what I store in the online services are downloaded PDF files or
documents that
I received through my educational experiences.  Those are already generally
publicly available. And, while they might provide some insight into what
interests me, they would hardly provide anything that could be considered
compromising.  So, privacy, at least for me, isn&amp;rsquo;t much of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, having said that, I do have to concede one area that could become
problematic from the privacy perspective.  I write a lot.  Most of it is for
working out my own thoughts and ideas.  Some of it is part of various projects
that I&amp;rsquo;m working on (stories, or my dissertation, for example). Although not
sensitive in the sense of compromising my privacy, these writings do involve
some levels of
copyright.  Should my online account at one of these big providers be
compromised, my claim to copyright on these documents could be compromised.  The
likelihood of that occurring is minimal, but it is, nonetheless, a risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;security&#34;&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security, to me, is part of, but separate from, privacy.  A secure service
protects my privacy, to be sure.  But what I&amp;rsquo;m referring to here is protecting
my work from loss.  If I have files that I truly do not want to lose, I want to
ensure that I&amp;rsquo;ve got them saved in multiple places so that I can be sure that I
don&amp;rsquo;t lose them.  As I mentioned earlier in this post, I have taken measures to
ensure that my important files are backed up to another computer in the event
that my server or hard drive crashes.  But, if my house burns down, I&amp;rsquo;m still
out of luck.  Except that I&amp;rsquo;ve also saved those files to my OneDrive account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with saving them to an outside vendor, whether it be Dropbox, Box, or
OneDrive, is that those companies might, at any given moment, decide to simply
disappear from the face of the Earth, taking my important files with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternately, they may sell out to another company that doesn&amp;rsquo;t take the same
precautions, or that decides to hold my data hostagse.  Not an enticing scenario
and, hopefully, an unlikely one. But, taking that risk is &amp;hellip;, well, a risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storage----the-defining-factor&#34;&gt;Storage &amp;ndash; The Defining Factor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest draw for using a service like Nextcloud is available
storage. Unlike the online providers, all of which limit storage, storage for
your self-hosted Nextcloud account is limited only by the available storage on
the server in your home.  Need More? Add another drive, or upgrade to a larger
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, my free OneDrive account is limited to
5 GB of storage.  Dropbox is currently limited to 2GB and will cost you $100 for
a 1TB option. Box offers 10 GB storage with their free plan and $120 a year for
a 100GB plan.  Oh, and all these have upload caps, so if you&amp;rsquo;re uploading big
files, you might be out of luck.  As I mentioned earlier, I have Office365
account that provides my Exchange services, as well as 1TB storage.  I&amp;rsquo;m
probably good there (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if there are upload limits, though I&amp;rsquo;m
sure there are!) But, I&amp;rsquo;ve have that account for about 6 years, during which
time I&amp;rsquo;ve watched the provided services change and generally decline.  I would
not be surprised if, on my next renewal, the amount of available (paid) storage
diminishes. And, that is the risk with all of these services, particularly the
free services: At any time the provide can choose to lower their limits and
suddenly you&amp;rsquo;re locked out of your data, or required to pony up cash to keep the
account usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is not really an issue for me. Part of the reason is because I do
have that
1TB of
paid-for storage, but more importantly because I have several TB of storage on
my local server, without upload limits, and have easy access through my VPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-where-am-i-truly-at&#34;&gt;So, Where Am I Truly At?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For right now, I&amp;rsquo;m leaving the Nextcloud and OnlyOffice servers running.&lt;br&gt;
Whether I will use them is a question that only time will answer.  I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued
by the ability to do on-line editing much as Office Online and Google Docs can
do.  In fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t really see any differences between the various online
editing services based on my general use cases.  I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to play with them
to see whether they meet any specific need that I might have not yet identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wind down my dissertation work my needs for high-powered writing tools
diminishes, as does my need for document storage. In that light, Nextcloud may
provide all the services I need for daily work.  Time will tell that tale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving to a Self-Hosted Bookmarking Service</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;moving-to-a-self-hosted-bookmarking-service&#34;&gt;Moving to a Self-Hosted Bookmarking Service&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a hint that bookmarks are going away.  Services like Delicious that used
to provide great web-based book marking services have closed down.  In their
place are the likes of Instapaper and Pinboard and the like that break stuff
into different types. Instapaper to store sites that you want to read later,
Pinterest for images you like, and so forth.  That doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well for me,
though.  I want everything in one place.  That&amp;rsquo;s also why I decided to try a&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a hint that bookmarks are going away.  Services like Delicious that used

Pinterest for images you like, and so forth.  That doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well for me,
though.  I want everything in one place.  That&amp;rsquo;s also why I decided to try a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;couple of web-based products.  I realized that I had bookmarks scattered over
three different browsers, on three different computers. How confusing can it
get?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-self-hosted&#34;&gt;Why Self Hosted?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a variety of services already available on line, why do I want to
self-host? After all, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work to get things set up and to keep
things running correctly.  It would be much simpler to use a series that
already exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary reason is safety.  That is, These services like to shut down without
a lot of notice.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to collect lots of bookmarks only to have the
service shutdown, taking my links with them. I want them to persist.  By hosting
my own, the only risk is that my computer will die.  I back things up for that
reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason is privacy.  It&amp;rsquo;s not so much what I&amp;rsquo;m bookmarking. I don&amp;rsquo;t
really care if you know what I bookmark.  But I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care that you don&amp;rsquo;t try to
market me, or sell my information to someone else who will market me. When using
another service, that risk is real &amp;ndash; they do have to make money.  But, by
hosting my own, I know that can&amp;rsquo;t happen. And, if it does, I get the financial
proceeds :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-services-am-i-using&#34;&gt;What Services Am I Using?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, these services are falling to the wayside, so there aren&amp;rsquo;t a lot of
scripts that are still available and being actively maintained.  I found 3:
SemanticScuttle, Unmark, and Shaarli.  I installed all three so that I could try
them out to see what works for me.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which one I&amp;rsquo;ll settle one. But,
I&amp;rsquo;m already sure which one I won&amp;rsquo;t be using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into any specifics, though, let me give you a little background on
what I prefer. And, where I&amp;rsquo;m likely going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tags&lt;/em&gt; have been around for a while now and I&amp;rsquo;ve rarely used them.  I&amp;rsquo;ll touch
on that in another post.  I&amp;rsquo;m a bit old-fashioned and a little linear in my
thinking.  I like being able to save a bookmark to a specific folder so that I
can quickly find the list of bookmarks related to a specific subject. Yes, I
know tagss allow that, and more and, again, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that in another post.&lt;br&gt;
but bear with me for right now.  I wanted something that would allow me to
import my current bookmarks, maintaining the current structure. None of the
available scripts allowed this (there is one, but it tried to be too many
things, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried it in the past, and its interface is hopelessly outdated).  I
also wanted
to be able to quickly and easily remove duplicates.  And, of course, it had to
be easy to access and use. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at the three
I installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unmark&#34;&gt;Unmark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, none of the three I found supported folders; all supported
tagsging, so I ended up going through and tagsging all my bookmarks.  Unmark held
a lot of promise. I read a lot of good things online about it.  IN practice, I
wasn&amp;rsquo;t impressed. The biggest issue is that Unmark wouldn&amp;rsquo;t import the tagss
associated with the links.  That meant I&amp;rsquo;d need to go through and re-tags all
those links.  That didn&amp;rsquo;t impress me.  Moving forward, of course, it&amp;rsquo;s less an
issue.  But, initially, at least, Unmark failed. I&amp;rsquo;ve also has some issues with
Unmark not loading correctly after signing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;semanticscuttle&#34;&gt;SemanticScuttle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SS imported bookmarks and tagss without issue.  So far, too, it&amp;rsquo;s been easy to
use.  I&amp;rsquo;m still using this one to try to see what it&amp;rsquo;s limits are. So far,
though, I&amp;rsquo;m impressed.  The one drawback is that it depends on a MySQL database.&lt;br&gt;
Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with DBs for years and don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; automatically discount a script
that uses one.  But, I think for my uses, a DB is simply overkill.  It requires
a lot of resource for little added benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shaarli&#34;&gt;Shaarli&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaarli and SS are running neck and neck in the which one does Kevin use race.&lt;br&gt;
From the user perspective, the two are identical.  And, like SS, Shaarli
imported tagss without issue.  Sweet.  The other thing about Shaarli that I like
is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on a database.  It uses a simple XML file to store its
data.  That not only makes backing up the data dead simple, it also means
minimal resources.  I could literally copy the files to a new computer and just
keep going. That is an awesome feature.  Shaarli also allows you tom make short
notes, or even use it as a pastebin kind of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-one-do-i-recommend&#34;&gt;Which One Do I Recommend?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet.  Unlike some folks that spend a day or two playing with a
service and then making a pronouncement about how good (or bad) it is, I want to
work with them a while to see which fits into my work flow best.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;technology-for-its-own-sake&#34;&gt;Technology For It&amp;rsquo;s Own Sake&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About eight years ago I spent a couple of years teaching high school. Being a nurse, and coming into the experience with no real educational background it was quite an interesting, and eye-opening experience. Needless to say, I probably learned more than my students did. One of the things that left me scratching my head was the approach the school system took toward education. Tons of money was spent on technology and teachers were required to have at least one “technology lesson” each week. That lesson had to be so designated on your weekly lesson plan. Talk about misguided! As I write this I still see a lot of the same things happening in education — at all levels. And it’s just plain dumb. Let’s explore this a bit. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;technology-for-its-own-sake&#34;&gt;Technology For It&amp;rsquo;s Own Sake&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About eight years ago I spent a couple of years teaching high school. Being a nurse, and coming into the experience with no real educational background it was quite an interesting, and eye-opening experience. Needless to say, I probably learned more than my students did. One of the things that left me scratching my head was the approach the school system took toward education. Tons of money was spent on technology and teachers were required to have at least one “technology lesson” each week. That lesson had to be so designated on your weekly lesson plan. Talk about misguided! As I write this I still see a lot of the same things happening in education — at all levels. And it’s just plain dumb. Let’s explore this a bit. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;build-it-and-they-will-come&#34;&gt;Build It and They Will Come&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s suppose, for a moment, that I’m running a for profit business. Where and when I spend money is determined by the needs that spending that money will meet. Outside of research and development it is unlikely that I would spend large sums of money on equipment and software for which I don’t already have a defined purpose. Stating that a bit differently, purchases are driven by the need the purchase will meet. A businessman would be foolish to spend large sums of money on a piece of equipment then turn to his staff and say, “well, here it is. Figure out how we can use it!” But that’s what schools do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the metrics used to judge school systems, apparently, is the technology available within the system.  Thus, IT leaders in education become focused on procuring equipment and software that they can then point to as evidence of their “forward thinking” and/or their technologic support of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, often that technology sits in the classroom unused. Why? Three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.    The technology is purchased without a clear purpose in mind. No one asks the question: What instructional need is this purchase fulfilling? With no clear instructional purpose, the equipment is simply not used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.    While money was spent to buy the equipment and software, little or no money is spent to train teachers to use it.  Shown how to use the technology, and how it can be beneficial in the classroom, I think many teachers would be accepting of new technologies. However, this is seldom done. They’re left to their own motivation. That leads us to the third problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.    Teachers already have a lot on their plates. They have no motivation to learn new technologies that may not have value in their classrooms. That is, with so many competing priorities in teaching today, teachers don’t want to spend time trying to learn a technology that may not be of benefit in moving them toward the goal of educating their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT directors in schools should be educators and they should be capable of evaluating the utility of the technologies in the classroom setting. Purchases should be driven not by a desire to “look good” on some report, or by a desire to “try out” new technologies, but by the need in the classroom. Interestingly, it seems that often the decisions are made without input from teachers and when teachers do make recommendations, or requests for specific technologies, their input is ignored or minimized. Heaven forbid that a faculty member should request software, or access to an online technology that they have determined would be beneficial to their classroom. Their request may well be denied. After all, who are they to evaluate software? And, there’s likely to be no money in the budget for such requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;technology-for-technologys-sake&#34;&gt;Technology for Technology’s Sake&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I note above, the idea of having at least one “technology lesson plan” each week is equally ludicrous.  Technology should always be the tool to achieving an outcome. Unless you’re teaching a technology course, the technology should not be the focus. Like buying equipment without a purpose, using technology (or requiring its use) when it contributes little to the outcomes is ridiculous for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.    Not all topics benefit from the use of technology. As adjunctive activities technology-based activities might have a place in some classrooms. For example, using storyboarding software to create a storyboard of a reading in a literature class might be beneficial in reinforcing what is learned. On the other hand, simply having the student prepare a PowerPoint on the topic likely does no more for learning than having them take notes. Why not just have them take notes, instead of introducing the complexity of the software into the equation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.    Teachers seldom have the level of skill needed to teach students how to use the technology— I”m an English teacher, not a computer teacher, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.    A corollary to  #2 is that students are often significantly more sophisticated in their ability to use current technologies than are their teachers. So, the teacher assigns the creation of a PowerPoint (which students have now done hundreds of times) and the student is bored. Why not allow the student to select a technology to use to present an idea? I’m betting theirs would be much more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are other reasons, but I’ll let you add them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point in all of this is that technology is, and should be seen as, a tool in the teacher’s toolbox. You would never hand someone a wrench and tell them to figure out how to build a house with it. Neither should you demand that teachers use a specific technology in their classrooms. Teachers should always be free to choose the tools that best meet the needs of the classroom. But, to help them understand the tools available to them, they should be properly trained in the use of all their tools, not just a few. Finally, teachers should feel free to request  and be allowed to use whatever resources they feel best meet the needs of their classroom. It should never be the IT director’s decision on what is appropriate for the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The State of the MOOC</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-state-of-the-mooc&#34;&gt;The State of the MOOC&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent articles about &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Massive Open Online Courses&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; (MOOC) got my attention this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fail&#34;&gt;Fail?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/10/new-study-low-mooc-completion-rates&#34;&gt;first article&lt;/a&gt; brings to the fore the reality that only about 7% of those who start a MOOC course complete it. This is, of course, a major concern for educators, given that completion rates are the major metric for colleges. It is completely understandable that many would see that number and conclude that MOOCs are failing. I’m not sure I agree with that assessment for several reasons.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-state-of-the-mooc&#34;&gt;The State of the MOOC&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent articles about &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Massive Open Online Courses&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; (MOOC) got my attention this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fail&#34;&gt;Fail?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/10/new-study-low-mooc-completion-rates&#34;&gt;first article&lt;/a&gt; brings to the fore the reality that only about 7% of those who start a MOOC course complete it. This is, of course, a major concern for educators, given that completion rates are the major metric for colleges. It is completely understandable that many would see that number and conclude that MOOCs are failing. I’m not sure I agree with that assessment for several reasons.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it’s important to remember that MOOCs are a new and novel concept that has received a tremendous amount of public press. Many people are curious to know what the hype is all about and may well have signed up to take a course simply to see what the hype was all about. Once their curiosity was satisfied they dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other students may have signed up with specific learning needs on the topic. Once their learning needs were satisfied they, too, dropped out. This is one of the benefits of the ‘open’ aspect of the MOOC; students are free to come and go as they please, according to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third factor is the low, or no cost, aspect of the MOOC. One of the basic concepts of the MOOC is that the courses are available at little or no cost. This has, I think, two implications. The first is that the low, or no, cost of the course means the student has nothing to lose by signing up. This could lead to many students signing up for courses. The second implication is that with no “skin in the game” the student has no real incentive to work hard to achieve. Fowler (2013) points out a Coursera study that finds that students who pay $30 – $60 for an Identify Verification service associated with the course are “significantly” more likely to complete the course.  Surely cost, and having skin in the game, makes a difference on completion rates. At the same, time, I’m not sure which comes first. Are they more likely to complete &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they paid the fee, or are they more likely to pay the fee because they want to complete the course?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final reason, at least in my mind, is that many MOOCs are simply poorly designed and, as a consequence, students found the format unpalatable. MOOCs are based on some very specific concepts. One of those concepts is that students contribute to the learning process with the faculty serving as guide.  In other words, students are actively involved in their education. Many courses, however, appear to be highly structured courses with an over-reliance on video lectures and assigned reading. Students simply don’t want to sit passively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;who-are-moocs-for&#34;&gt;Who are MOOCs for?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no question that completion is an issue, it turns out that the one who are completing already have some &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/moocs-are-reaching-only-privileged-learners-survey-finds/48567&#34;&gt;college-level education&lt;/a&gt; — usually at least a baccalaureate degree. This comes as a bit of surprise, apparently, to some of the folk who felt that MOOCs would be the salvation for underprivileged students. Frankly, I’m not surprised. The design of MOOCs require the student to bring the ability to study independently to the table. Moreover, the concepts that underly the MOOC rely on student interest and motivation. The undergraduate student often lacks both the skills needed for independent study and the motivation and interest to seek out the knowledge the course is intended to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the MOOC has a couple of  very specific niche markets. I think that MOOCs are great resources for the individual who wants to know more about some topic without necessarily wanting a degree. These individuals are motivated to learn, not because they need the degree but because they want to know more. These folk, not surprisingly, are often already well educated. Their motivation might be to gain the knowledge to move into a new position or to deepen their knowledge for a position they’ve recently been promoted into. Or, it may simply be to fulfill a curiosity. Many well-educated people tend to expand their interests into new areas. The MOOC is a perfect vehicle for meeting that interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These well-educated people also bring a history of study skills to the table, making the MOOC not only more appealing to them, but making them more likely to be successful in that environment. This is one of the major issues, in my view, for those considering offering MOOCs to undergraduate students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;wrapping-it-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping it Up…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that MOOCs are a potentially valuable way for people to learn new skills that they need to improve their work situations, or to expand their interests. On the other hand, I don’t think that they are the best option for teaching students who are not already well versed in studying. Stay tuned, though, because things are always subject to change!&lt;/p&gt;
