<p>The title of this blog is iamcuri.us.  That title was chosen to reflect the many and sundry interests that I have and the drive I have to explore new ideas and to learn new things.  While I think some of my posts here have reflected that, others seems to skew in specific directions that seem to narrow the focus on the blog.  Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.  Maybe the posts that outline my tinkering in websites and self-hosting do reflect my questioning and exploring and learning. Still, I think that it&rsquo;s time I pushed into some new areas a<!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd revisit in more detail some old areas, too.</p>

<p>Had someone told me on the day of my high school graduation in 1977 that I would one day be an academic, in possession of a doctoral degree and teaching at the university level, I&rsquo;d have warned them that whatever<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they were smoking was muddling their brain. Yet, here I am, forty years later, in possession of not one, but two master&rsquo;s degrees, and a doctorate, teaching at a university.  How did that happen?</p>

<p>I love to read and love to learn, so it is no suprise that one of my favorite pastimes is to wander through bookstores. I love perusing the titles, skimming a few pages of those that interest me and maybe marking a few to add to my reading list. It&rsquo;s a habit I developed probably thirty years ago.</p>
<p>One of the subject areas I generally skim is the business management section. Learning about management styles and techniques is interesting and informative.  Last fall, however, as  I was skimming titles, I had an epihany.  As I skimmed the titles I became aware of just how many titles purported to embue the reader <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with &ldquo;the one thing&rdquo; that they could do to be the best leader, the best manager, to build the most successful company, and &hellip; well, you get the idea. As I looked further, I found books of similar types in other subject areas.  It seems that everyone one is looking for the ONE THING that gives them an advantagse. The problem was that in skimming the books it quickly became apparent that the &ldquo;one thing&rdquo; differed from book to book.</p>

<p>Virtually all businesses today are concerned about how the public perceives them.  They recognize &ndash; and rightfully so, in my opinion &ndash; that customers who have a positive experience, who receive great service, or receive quality, tasty foods are more likely to be repeat customers.  They also know that customers who have a poor experience are just as unlikely to return.  Thus, measuring the customer experience by asking the customer to complete a survey of their experience is an important means for getting information on how<!-- raw HTML omitted --> well the company is doing in meeting the customers&rsquo; needs and expectations.  I&rsquo;m not sure all managers understand the value of the survey and the need for accurate feedback.</p>

<p>Throughout my junior high years I was a huge science fiction fan.  One of my favorite authors of the time was  Isaac Asimov.  I was quite surprised to learn that Asimov not only wrote science fiction but had also penned books, short stories, and essays that ranged from religion (Guide to the Bible), chemistry (he was educated as a biochemist), engineering, and the list goes on.  This realization intially confused me.  How <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could a science fiction writer be so bold as to write on so many different topics? How could he know enough in each of those fields to qualify himself to write books on them?  It would be many years before I encountered the term &ldquo;polymath&rdquo;, but surely Asimov earned the title.</p>
