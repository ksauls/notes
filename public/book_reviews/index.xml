&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the acknowledgements, author and scholar Brian Hoffman notes that the idea for this book grew out of his own early experiences in a clothing optional home/community. He noted that as he grew older he became increasingly aware that what was normal in his own life was not nearly so normal for most others, at least in the US.  It was, he suggests, that dichotomy between his experiences and the broader social order that led him to explore the history and influences on nudist life. As he notes in the acknowledgement, he tried to avoid coming across as a dyed-in-the-wool nudist who was seeking to justify his lifestyle but rather wanted to present a fact-based perspective on a lifestyle that is different from mainstream society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the acknowledgements, author and scholar Brian Hoffman notes that the idea for this book grew out of his own early experiences in a clothing optional home/community. He noted that as he grew older he became increasingly aware that what was normal in his own life was not nearly so normal for most others, at least in the US.  It was, he suggests, that dichotomy between his experiences and the broader social order that led him to explore the history and influences on nudist life. As he notes in the acknowledgement, he tried to avoid coming across as a dyed-in-the-wool nudist who was seeking to justify his lifestyle but rather wanted to present a fact-based perspective on a lifestyle that is different from mainstream society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book it self takes the reader on a fact-based history of nudity and nudism in the US.  One of the things that struck me as I read the book was how cyclic many of the issues are and, at the same time, how our focus and values shift over time.  It also underscores how tightly we in the US associate nakedness with sexuality.  The book focuses on the legal and social influences in the US and, beyond noting the influence of German Freikörperkultur on  the development of nudism in the US, does not touch on how social nudity is handled in other countries.  I think a more global exploration of nudity would be quite enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key ideas I got from the book is that there are, and will always be, people who see the negative in the world; those whose minds will always expect the worst and are willing to throw out the baby with the bath water. They are the folks who presume to tell others how to live and find any excuse, shaky or not, to justify their crusades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does not shy away from addressing the reality that there are people who leverage situations for their own advantage.  That is, yes, there are swingers in the nudist community.  There are pedophiles in the nudist community. And, yes, in an effort to protect the community many times those transgressions were ignored or explained away.  There are also people and groups who hijack ideas and twist them to their own agendas.  Unfortunately, we&amp;rsquo;re seeing a lot of that in politics today but it is really not much different today than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the book also makes the point that there is room for a variety of perspectives.  Are nudists more sexually liberated than mainstream society?  That&amp;rsquo;s a question the book only tangentially addresses.  The astute reader, however, my infer from the information provided that people who are more open to nudism, more comfortable in their bodies, are likely to be more tolerant of alternative views of relationships.  Whether that is good or bad depends, I suppose, on one&amp;rsquo;s own point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Book Review - A Curious Mind</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book_reviews/book-review-a-curious-mind/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book_reviews/book-review-a-curious-mind/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/b14798115985144bc798024764ad1773_MD5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-curious-mind&#34;&gt;A Curious Mind&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, and have always been, a curious person so when I saw this book at the book store I had no choice but to select it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is a driving force that pushes us to learn more, understand more, and to find or create new things.  Curiosity is also the foundation for creativity, which is the premise for Brian Grazer&amp;rsquo;s book, &amp;ldquo;A Curious Mind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the name sound familiar, but you &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; can&amp;rsquo;t quite nail down his name, Brian is the producer of many hit movies, including &lt;em&gt;Splash, Apollo 13, Friday Night Lights, and A Beautiful Life&lt;/em&gt; among many others.  Brian credits his curiosity for both getting him into the movie industry and with his success within that industry.  He points to how his curiosity, and what he calls &amp;ldquo;curiosity conversations&amp;rdquo;, has expanded his understanding of people and phenomena,  allowed him to explore new ideas in unique ways, for developing a deeper understanding of others, and for providing him the foundation for identifying good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am, and have always been, a curious person so when I saw this book at the book store I had no choice but to select it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is a driving force that pushes us to learn more, understand more, and to find or create new things.  Curiosity is also the foundation for creativity, which is the premise for Brian Grazer&amp;rsquo;s book, &amp;ldquo;A Curious Mind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the name sound familiar, but you &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; can&amp;rsquo;t quite nail down his name, Brian is the producer of many hit movies, including &lt;em&gt;Splash, Apollo 13, Friday Night Lights, and A Beautiful Life&lt;/em&gt; among many others.

He points to how his curiosity, and what he calls &amp;ldquo;curiosity conversations&amp;rdquo;, has expanded his understanding of people and phenomena,  allowed him to explore new ideas in unique ways, for developing a deeper understanding of others, and for providing him the foundation for identifying good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book spends a good bit of time talking about the role curiosity has played in Brian&amp;rsquo;s success but it also gives good advice on how to harness your curiosity to open your life to greater opportunity.  To be successfully curious, you need to do two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be willing to listen to the answers you receive when you ask questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bw willing to act on what you learn.  He used the example of our curiosity about whether we could go to the moon was one thing; marshaling the resources to make that happen was another.  Only through being willing to act on our curiosity &amp;ndash; to answer the question and to explore the possibilities of making it happen &amp;ndash; can curiosity really open up our lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique aspect of the book is his focus on &amp;ldquo;Curiosity Conversations&amp;rdquo;.  Throughout his adult professional life Brian has tried to meet regularly with people he was curious about &amp;ndash; everyone from Isaac Asimov to Sheldon Glashow, a Nobel Prize winning physicist &amp;ndash; to gain insight into their thoughts and what drives them to do the things they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book points out that curiosity is often looked upon with derision.  Curious people are not often well received and asking questions can be considered rude. And yet is it curiosity that has driven almost all of the innovation we have experienced.  Though not in the book, curiosity, the question of &amp;lsquo;can this be done?&amp;rsquo;, has even led to the relatively rapid development of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-liked-about-the-book&#34;&gt;What I Liked About the Book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiosity is a big motivator in my life so the whole notion of a book that explores how curiosity impacted someone else is always enlightening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He provides examples  of how curiosity led to some of his decisions in life and in his career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book provides suggestions on how to ramp up your curiosity and how to then use that curiosity to ramp up your life. (Note that these are not &amp;lsquo;formulas&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;how tos&amp;rsquo;, but simple suggestions that you might implement in your life.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-didnt-like-about-the-book&#34;&gt;What I Didn&amp;rsquo;t Like About the Book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, I think the book is pretty good as it is.  The book provides a great many examples, which does become somewhat redundant at times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the examples help the reader to understand what curiosity can lead to and how it can affect your life, they can come across as a bit of name-dropping at times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-i-recommend-the-book&#34;&gt;Do I Recommend the Book?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Even if you&amp;rsquo;re not a terribly curious person, the book is an interesting read that provide a look inside how a movie producer came to that profession and was able to leverage their curiosity into a (very) successful career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a curious person, the book provides further evidence that curiosity is a great tool for personal and professional growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book that, in fact, I will likely re-read at some point in the future to refresh and revitalize my own curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-quotes&#34;&gt;Some Quotes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to ask any question embodies two things: the freedom to go chase the answer, and the ability to challenge authority, to ask, &amp;ldquo;How come you&amp;rsquo;re in charge?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiosity is a form of power, and also a form of courage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Referring to the film executive and producer John Calley of Warner Brothers)  &amp;hellip; watching Calley work, I realized something: Creative thoughts didn&amp;rsquo;t have to follow a straight narrative line. You could pursue your interests, your passions, you could chase any quirky idea that came from som odd corner of your experience or your brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; Storytelling and curiosity are natural allies.  &amp;hellip; The story is a repot from the front lines of curiosity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are all trapped in our own way of thinking, trapped in our own way of relating to people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Book Review: Noise by Daniel Kahneman</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book_reviews/noise/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book_reviews/noise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fhIBEAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;img=1&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;edge=curl&amp;amp;source=gbs_api&#34; alt=&#34;cover|150&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;noise&#34;&gt;Noise&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;by-daniel-kahnemnan&#34;&gt;By Daniel Kahnemnan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often like to think that decision-makers use sound, rational judgment when making decisions. Using examples from the courtroom, Human Resources, insurance adjusters, and others, Kahneman and team show that, in fact, our judgments are strongly, and unconsciously, affected by a multitude of seemingly irrelevant factors such as the weather, how hunger the decision-maker is, and even whether the local sports team won their game over the prior weekend. These are what he terms Noise.  He differentiates noise from bias and notes that both can, and frequently do, coexist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fhIBEAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;img=1&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;edge=curl&amp;amp;source=gbs_api&#34; alt=&#34;cover|150&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;noise&#34;&gt;Noise&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;by-daniel-kahnemnan&#34;&gt;By Daniel Kahnemnan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often like to think that decision-makers use sound, rational judgment when making decisions. Using examples from the courtroom, Human Resources, insurance adjusters, and others, Kahneman and team show that, in fact, our judgments are strongly, and unconsciously, affected by a multitude of seemingly irrelevant factors such as the weather, how hunger the decision-maker is, and even whether the local sports team won their game over the prior weekend. These are what he terms Noise.  He differentiates noise from bias and notes that both can, and frequently do, coexist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with any of Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s other work such as &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt; , the concepts presented in this book will be familiar to you and many of the conclusions are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does present the flaws in human judgment in interesting ways and provides suggestions on how to minimize the effects of those flaws. As Kahneman notes, it not possible to completely eliminate errors, noting that even he falls victim to such errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-liked-about-the-book&#34;&gt;What I Liked About the Book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presents good information in clear ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reminds the reader that there is only an illusion of fairness in many judgments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reminds the reader that two &amp;rsquo;experts&amp;rsquo; given the same information may come to very different conclusions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides many examples to aid in understanding the concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides suggestions for mitigating the flaws in judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-didnt-like-about-the-book&#34;&gt;What I Didn&amp;rsquo;t Like About the Book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think the biggest con for this book is that it feels a bit repetitious. This may be because I&amp;rsquo;m already familiar with Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s work, but the book feels a bit longer than it needed to be to achieve the same outcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-i-recommend-the-book&#34;&gt;Do I Recommend the Book?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does provide some good insight into why judgments can vary from person-to-person when given the same information.  Any time I can learn more about the flaws in how we think and make decisions, I&amp;rsquo;m for it.  While this book focuses on the flaws in judgment and explains how those seemingly irrelevant factors may contribute to those flaws, it is an extension of his earlier work on thinking and decision-making.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve not already read &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt; I would recommend that you read that book first so that you have a fuller understanding when he references concepts such as System I or System II thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Book Review: The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book_reviews/almanack-naval-ravikant/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book_reviews/almanack-naval-ravikant/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0jxbzwEACAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;img=1&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;source=gbs_api&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;left&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/home/kevin/hugo/images/b14798115985144bc798024764ad1773_MD5.jpg&#34;   /&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never heard of Naval Ravikant until the book popped up in the search results for personal finance books on Amazon. Or wealth, I don&amp;rsquo;t really remember what that search term was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this book is not about personal finance. Instead, it is a collection of thoughts by Naval Ravikant, a venture capitalist, founder or co-founder of several successful websites  including the consumer reviews website Epinions.com, Angelist.com, producthunt.com and others.  He has been an early investor in over 200 companies, including Uber, Poshmark, wish.com, Twitter, and Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;figure class=&#34;left&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/home/kevin/hugo/images/b14798115985144bc798024764ad1773_MD5.jpg&#34;   /&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never heard of Naval Ravikant until the book popped up in the search results for personal finance books on Amazon. Or wealth, I don&amp;rsquo;t really remember what that search term was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this book is not about personal finance. Instead, it is a collection of thoughts by Naval Ravikant, a venture capitalist, founder or co-founder of several successful websites  including the consumer reviews website Epinions.com, Angelist.com, producthunt.com and others.  He has been an early investor in over 200 companies, including Uber, Poshmark, wish.com, Twitter, and Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book captures Naval&amp;rsquo;s unique view of the world and a plethora of profound perspectives on what is needed to achieve wealth and happiness in today&amp;rsquo;s world.  Much of what he promotes, surprisingly, is contrary to what the vast majority of people believe to be true. Most certainly his view is not what one might expect from a venture capitalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-liked-about-the-book&#34;&gt;What I Liked About the Book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the TL;DR version is &amp;ldquo;everything!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book covers a wide range of topics from building wealth to living a happy life.  There&amp;rsquo;s a fair amount of philosophical thought, some Buddhist thinking, and some honest evaluation of religion and the role it plays in one&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, perhaps the most important takeaway from the book is that following the crowd is the path to mediocrity.  If you want to truly become wealthy (which can be defined in various ways) you want to identify what is unique to you and leverage that into a career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is broken into two major sections, Wealth and Happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the tidbits that resonated with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We each have unique interests and talents.  Work to identify what those are and figure out how you can leverage them into a career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is vital to understand how wealth is built, how your unique knowledge contributes to that process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working toward long-term rather than short-term outcomes better ensures success and wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing what you love, that which most deeply interests you, ensures that you&amp;rsquo;ll do the best job you can do.  This, in turn, ensures that the work you do is eventually recognized and required by others who will pay you well for that work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of thinking clearly and proper decision-making (and how to do both!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more that I liked about the book which I won&amp;rsquo;t go into here.  Read it for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-didnt-like-about-the-book&#34;&gt;What I Didn&amp;rsquo;t Like About the Book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t say anything bad about the book.  I was actually surprised at that, as usually I find something with which I disagree in most people&amp;rsquo;s perspectives.  That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that you might not find issues, based on your own perspective.  He speaks to religion in several places and I suspect not everyone will agree with his perspective.  That said, I think it&amp;rsquo;s important that he made those statements not so much to push his view but to challenge the reader to take a step back and look at our beliefs in a different light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-i-recommend-this-book&#34;&gt;Do I Recommend this Book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unabashedly, YES.  Again, even if you disagree with some of his views, that&amp;rsquo;s okay.  He even points out that blindly taking someone else&amp;rsquo;s perspective as your own is wrong.  Just because a particular hack worked for one person doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;ll work for you. Questioning his perspective is healthy as it helps you to refine your own world view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, this is a book that I will likely return to again and again just for a fresh infusion of clear thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the book is available through your normal channels but is also available, for free, at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.navalmanack.com&#34;&gt;https://www.navalmanack.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Book Review: The Richest Man in Babylon</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book_reviews/richest-man-in-babylon/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book_reviews/richest-man-in-babylon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H0EYaZ9-EckC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;img=1&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;edge=curl&amp;amp;source=gbs_api&#34; alt=&#34;cover|150&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;george-s-clasons-the-richest-man-in-babylon&#34;&gt;George S. Clason&amp;rsquo;s The Richest Man in Babylon&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is not really a single book but a collection of short pamphlets that Mr. Clason, a businessman in the early 1900&amp;rsquo;s, wrote on the topic of financial success.  Using parables set in ancient Babylonia, the pamphlets provide, generally, seven keys for becoming wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I quickly acknowledge that repetition of concepts aids in internalizing those ideas, I don&amp;rsquo;t usually care for books that include a lot of repetitive materialBecause the book is a collection of pamphlets, the same seven concepts, with the occasional additional idea thrown in, are repeated multiple times throughout the book using different characters and settings to convey the seven principles.

&lt;h1 id=&#34;george-s-clasons-the-richest-man-in-babylon&#34;&gt;George S. Clason&amp;rsquo;s The Richest Man in Babylon&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is not really a single book but a collection of short pamphlets that Mr. Clason, a businessman in the early 1900&amp;rsquo;s, wrote on the topic of financial success.  Using parables set in ancient Babylonia, the pamphlets provide, generally, seven keys for becoming wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I quickly acknowledge that repetition of concepts aids in internalizing those ideas, I don&amp;rsquo;t usually care for books that include a lot of repetitive materialBecause the book is a collection of pamphlets, the same seven concepts, with the occasional additional idea thrown in, are repeated multiple times throughout the book using different characters and settings to convey the seven principles. Knowing that the book is a compilation makes the repetition a bit more palatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clason&amp;rsquo;s ideas show up in variety of different books and other personal finance resources couched in slightly different language, suggesting that his seven principles are foundational or, as some refer to them, first-principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-liked-about-the-book&#34;&gt;What I Liked About the Book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I found the seven (or eight, depending on how you want to read the book) to be on target.  Using the parables to present the concepts makes them easy to read and understand without going into unnecessary detail. Presenting the concepts in various different situations aids in comprehension and retention of the ideas.  As I said, generally I don&amp;rsquo;t care for a lot of repetitive messaging in books but for this one it seems to work.  In short, I liked everything about the book and understand why it is seen as a classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-didnt-like-about-the-book&#34;&gt;What I Didn&amp;rsquo;t Like About the Book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there was nothing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like!  How&amp;rsquo;s that for succinct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clason provides the foundational knowledge needed to for someone who wants to be wealthy to achieve that goal.  He emphasizes that it is through simple, consistent actions that wealth is achieved and reminds that reader that wealth is within everyone&amp;rsquo;s grasp, if only they&amp;rsquo;ll follow a few simple rules. I think that most personal finance books, videos, websites, etc try to make the topic much more complex than it needs to be. Yes, when you get into the nitty-gritty of investing and so on it can be quite complex. But Clason lets the reader know that even without that complexity achieving wealth is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-i-recommend-the-book&#34;&gt;Do I Recommend the Book?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely and without reservation.  For someone who is just starting out on their road to wealth, &lt;em&gt;The Richest Man in Babylon&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent primer in how wealth is accumulated.  Simple ideas such as &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; setting aside 10% of your income for savings, managing your expenses, and avoiding excess debt are easy to grasp and easy to accomplish, though a bit of self-discipline is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get started on the road to wealth, I can think of no better way to start than taking the time to read through and internalize the seven (or eight) ideas in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;why-do-i-say-seven-or-eight&#34;&gt;Why do I say &amp;ldquo;seven (or eight)&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, Clason lays out seven principles for achieving wealth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always hold back 10% of what you earn for yourself to be put into savings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control expenses so that you are only spending about 70% of what you earn for running your home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend you money on things that will increase your income or wealth &amp;ndash; take advantage of compound interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guard your wealth.  Don&amp;rsquo;t chase after get-rich-quick schemes that will most likely make someone else wealthy while impoverishing you.  Make safe investments that are backed by assets that can be converted to cash if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan for the future &amp;ndash; put money back for that time when you can no longer work or to care for your family if you&amp;rsquo;re no longer able to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivate your own power through continuous learning and skills development, particularly around ways to manage your finances more astutely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize that you create your own luck through knowledge, preparation, and awareness of opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eighth principle which, as I recall only appears in one story, is that doing good work, and giving more than is required to the task, is a necessary component in becoming wealthy.  Seeking the quick buck or trying to become wealthy without putting in your best effort will lead to ruin.  Even if you&amp;rsquo;ve built your wealth, continue to work toward refining you knowledge, skills, and abilities so that you can continue to build your wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

I had never heard of Naval Ravikant until the book popped up in the search results for personal finance books on Amazon. Or wealth, I don&#39;t really remember what that search term was!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, this book is not about personal finance. Instead, it is a collection of thoughts by Naval Ravikant, a venture capitalist, founder or co-founder of several successful websites  including the consumer reviews website Epinions.com, Angelist.com, producthunt.com and others.  He has been an early investor in over 200 companies, including Uber, Poshmark, wish.com, Twitter, and Stack Overflow.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book captures Naval&#39;s unique view of the world and a plethora of profound perspectives on what is needed to achieve wealth and happiness in today&#39;s world.  Much of what he promotes, surprisingly, is contrary to what the vast majority of people believe to be true. Most certainly his view is not what one might expect from a venture capitalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;h3 data-heading=&#34;What I Liked About the Book&#34; class=&#34;heading&#34; id=&#34;What_I_Liked_About_the_Book&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;svg-icon right-triangle&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M3 8L12 17L21 8&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;What I Liked About the Book&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-children&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the TL;DR version is &#34;everything!&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book covers a wide range of topics from building wealth to living a happy life.  There&#39;s a fair amount of philosophical thought, some Buddhist thinking, and some honest evaluation of religion and the role it plays in one&#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, perhaps the most important takeaway from the book is that following the crowd is the path to mediocrity.  If you want to truly become wealthy (which can be defined in various ways) you want to identify what is unique to you and leverage that into a career.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is broken into two major sections, Wealth and Happiness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the tidbits that resonated with me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li data-line=&#34;0&#34;&gt;We each have unique interests and talents.  Work to identify what those are and figure out how you can leverage them into a career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-line=&#34;1&#34;&gt;It is vital to understand how wealth is built, how your unique knowledge contributes to that process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-line=&#34;2&#34;&gt;Working toward long-term rather than short-term outcomes better ensures success and wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-line=&#34;3&#34;&gt;Doing what you love, that which most deeply interests you, ensures that you&#39;ll do the best job you can do.  This, in turn, ensures that the work you do is eventually recognized and required by others who will pay you well for that work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-line=&#34;4&#34;&gt;The value of thinking clearly and proper decision-making (and how to do both!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there&#39;s a lot more that I liked about the book which I won&#39;t go into here.  Read it for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;h3 data-heading=&#34;What I Didn&#39;t Like About the Book&#34; class=&#34;heading&#34; id=&#34;What_I_Didn&#39;t_Like_About_the_Book&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;svg-icon right-triangle&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M3 8L12 17L21 8&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;What I Didn&#39;t Like About the Book&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-children&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t say anything bad about the book.  I was actually surprised at that, as usually I find something with which I disagree in most people&#39;s perspectives.  That&#39;s not to say that you might not find issues, based on your own perspective.  He speaks to religion in several places and I suspect not everyone will agree with his perspective.  That said, I think it&#39;s important that he made those statements not so much to push his view but to challenge the reader to take a step back and look at our beliefs in a different light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;h3 data-heading=&#34;Do I Recommend this Book&#34; class=&#34;heading&#34; id=&#34;Do_I_Recommend_this_Book&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;svg-icon right-triangle&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M3 8L12 17L21 8&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Do I Recommend this Book&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-children&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unabashedly, YES.  Again, even if you disagree with some of his views, that&#39;s okay.  He even points out that blindly taking someone else&#39;s perspective as your own is wrong.  Just because a particular hack worked for one person doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll work for you. Questioning his perspective is healthy as it helps you to refine your own world view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In truth, this is a book that I will likely return to again and again just for a fresh infusion of clear thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the book is available through your normal channels but is also available, for free, at &lt;a rel=&#34;noopener&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.navalmanack.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.navalmanack.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;mod-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;sidebar-right sidebar&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;sidebar-handle&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;sidebar-topbar&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;topbar-content&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;3&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;svg-icon&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 4V20&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M4 7H7&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M4 10H7&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M4 13H7&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;sidebar-content&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;graph-view-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;sidebar-section-header&#34;&gt;Interactive Graph&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;graph-view-placeholder&#34;&gt;
