like Dropbox, OneDrive, and so forth. When I do, I start playing around with
self-hosted services such as NextCloud, OwnCloud, and so forth. I&rsquo;m currently in
one of those cycles and have been playing around a good bit with Nextcloud.</p>

<p>Today I fixed a problem that has vexed me for some time.  Reading through the
search pages, it seems it has vexed quite a few others, as well.  I thought I&rsquo;d
share my solution to this problem so that others might benefit.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What&rsquo;s the problem?  I&rsquo;ve setup a VPN server on my Ubiquiti Edgerouter-X. The
VPN works great with my Windows clients, but I&rsquo;ve not been able to get my
MacBook or iPhone to connect. Until today.  The problem turned out to be quite
simple, though it took a bit of reading to figure it out.</p>

<p>There has been a lot going on the last few months.  I have been struggling to
get my dissertation done. The biggest obstacle has been locating participants
for a qualitative study.  I <em>finally</em> got responses to my recruiting efforts and
have been able to interview 7 people.  That&rsquo;s not a great response, but is
better than nothing (which is what I had in the past!)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a hint that bookmarks are going away.  Services like Delicious that used
to provide great web-based book marking services have closed down.  In their
place are the likes of Instapaper and Pinboard and the like that break stuff
into different types. Instapaper to store sites that you want to read later,
Pinterest for images you like, and so forth.  That doesn&rsquo;t work well for me,
though.  I want everything in one place.  That&rsquo;s also why I decided to try a</p>

<p>One of the questions with which I have wrestled for a while now is the question of what it means to be ‘educated’.  The problem, of course, is that there is no one definition and that, I think, creates much of the problem in evaluating educational programs.  The state of Georgia recently put on the ballot a bill that would create an “Opportunity School District”. In an effort to address “failing” schools, the state proposed taking them over and doing whatever is necessary to ‘improve’ outcomes.  As I pondered the proposal, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> one of the questions that I continually confronted was what does it mean for school to “fail”? Who determines this? And, on what is it based?  Advertisements for the plan suggested that “only 12% of third graders in our failings schools are reading on grade-level.” That, of course, raised other questions for me.  For example, how does this compare to third graders in those schools that are not considered to be failing? What does it mean to read on grade level?  Recognizing that people learn at different rates and that skills such as reading are commonly dependent on external factors such as how much reading goes on in the home, is the standard even appropriate? These and several other questions brought me back around to the question of what it means to be educated.</p>
