  <p>Who am I?  That is the quintessential Existential question, isn&rsquo;t it?  Who am I?</p>
<p>I read somewhere years ago that we here in the US tend to answer that question by saying what career we&rsquo;re engaged in: I am a nurse. I am an engineer. I am a salesman. And so on.  But that doesn&rsquo;t really tell anyone who you are, it simply tells them how you make your living.  What about those of us who are retired? We no longer have job.  Does that mean we have no identify?  My answer is no, of course not! In fact, we are all many things, so answering that question becomes somewhat (or maybe a lot) more difficult to answer if we really want the other person to know who we really are.</p>
<p>So, let me try to tell you who I am.</p>
<p>To define myself through my relationships, I am a husband, father, step-father, grand-father, step-grandfather, brother, son, cousin,uncle, friend, and neighbor.  I have also been a coworker, study partner, student, classmate, and teacher.</p>
<p>To define myself in career terms, I have been a dishwasher, hamburger flipper, grocery stocker and cashier, receiving clerk, burglar alarm installer, computer tech support and helpdesk technician, network administrator, Registered Nurse and educator. I retired after 41 years in nursing, 20 in clinical practice and 21 more in nursing education.</p>
<p>To define myself educationally, I have a BS in nursing, an MS in Nursing, an MBA, and a doctorate in education, along with bits and pieces of other degrees that I never completed for one reason or another.</p>
<p>To define myself by my characteristics, I am a mildly overweight, mid-60&rsquo;s man with a fringe of grey hair  (thanks, male pattern baldness!), not the best eyesight, and creaky knees. I am intensely curious and easily distracted by the next shiny thing.</p>
<p>To define myself by my interests, I am an erstwhile musician, amateur radio operator, licensed (part 107) drone pilot, photographer, videographer, lover of nearly all things technologic, a bit of philosopher and a heavy reader.  There very few areas of study that don&rsquo;t hold some interest for me so you&rsquo;ll find me exploring any number of topics from the mundane to the esoteric.</p>
<p>So, who am I?  I am the result of the admixture of all of these elements (and probably a few I&rsquo;ve forgotten). I am a unique individual who just wants to explore my world, learn all I can about as much as I can and share what I learn with others.</p>
