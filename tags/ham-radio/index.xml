      <description>One of the goals on my bucket list has been getting my Ham radio license. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember, really, when it first landed on my list. I was a teen and it most likely was the result of some movie I saw or book I read that extolled the use and excitement of reaching out to the world through radio. The desire wasn&amp;rsquo;t helped, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, by having an uncle that got into it after he retired.</description>
